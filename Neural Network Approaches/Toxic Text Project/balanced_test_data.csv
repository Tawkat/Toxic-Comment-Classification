 In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the """"Unofficial symbols"""" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those. Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists. In the meantime (just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency) I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three.

 BLP question 

Hi,

Given your comment at the recent Trevor Marshall AFD, I would be interested in any comment you might have regarding [one].  I'm interested in a """"sincerely curious about how genuine, truthful, hurtful things should be handled on wikipedia"""" way, not in a """"pointy, I agree with you, who gives a crap about people's feelings"""" sort of way.  I don't often edit BLP pages, and outcomes like these two make me want to avoid them completely.  Any comment or links you might have to suggest are of interest to me.

  Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources:

 Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of """"reliable"""" which you have not familiarized yourself with. 

This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an """"admin in my pocket"""" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail. When you've read this entire page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself. Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care. Shame on all of you for your intellectual laziness, dishonesty, and irresponsible deleter reflexes.

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin's response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations.

Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland's herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote Eleland in the discussion on Caterpillar Inc.: Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument. Wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources. Reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct. Removing those reports because you think the activists aren't correct contradicts Wikipedia's core policies. Eleland

No I don't want to include the actor model in GR as you say (I have said this at least 3 times).Yes Hewitt sounds cranky at times, but as far as the category itself he's got a point.
My only comment was that the category relativistic information science is meaningful (see my comments above). Whether you or anybody else in GR doesn't like it, that's another matter. The category is called relativistic information science (not GR information science).
The only other person on WP who asked me about my credentials was a crank on a rather infamous discussion on Bell's theorem.

Greetings Athaenara, I see you maintaining WP:BLP/N and just wanted to say that it is good to see someone like yourself taking care of business there. Thanks for that. Also, I caught sight of your sig gallery and I must say that with the formatting and layout it is a pleasure to look at. Take it easy.  
Hey, thank you for the encouragement (BLP/N)!   If you don't mind, I'll put your comments about the gallery in the Gallery Guest Book section there, unless you would like to add your comments yourself—let me know.   
Autograph books are a bit contentious right now... I suppose I wouldn't mind if you transfer my comments there though. Cheers.  
Ah one other thing, many Wikipedia editor find large signatures annoying could you perhaps alter your to be like this: ? Large signatures tend to give sig users a bad name. -)  
It is not an autograph book (cf. my comments on the gallery talk page about that very thing) but a curated collection.  Thank you for your kind permission to add your comments to the guestbook.   

Inspired by your art
Hi, I feel inspired by your signature and a number of those in your gallery to render my own in an artistic fashion. I know how to do the art but is there a way to make it appear like that everytime I use the four tides or do I need to copy and paste all the time? -

 Review comments 

I took a brief look at the article after the recent peer review was closed. Here are a few comments for improvement - these are things that woulkd be a problem if this were up for WP:FAC or even WP:GAN.
The lead is five paragraphs but WP:LEAD says the limit is four paragraphs.
The lead does not summarize the article well - my rule of thumb is to include every section in the lead somehow, but the Munic Crisis, his marriage and children, his children with other women, and his death are not in the lead
WP:MOSQUOTE says that all direct quotations need to have a reference (even if they are in the lead)
To be free, most historic images need to have been published before 1923 or their source must be given so clearly that it can be determined that the image was published without a copyright notice or its copyright has expired. Images like File:CAL CAM2 DH4 Nov 4 1926.jpg were clearly taken after 1923, and lack the information as to sources that allow any sort of determination of copyright status.
Or how is this image not still under copyright - published in 1927 at the earliest File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg?
The relevant policy for WP:FAIRUSE images is WP:NFCC, every point of which has to be met for an image to be used under fair use guidelines. I often ask myself three questions about fair use images: 1) Does the image increase the reader's understanding of the article's subject? 2) Is the image discussed in the article itself? 3) Is the image used merely for decorative purposes? NFCC requires minimal use - all of which leads to me to ask: How do two separate Fair Use covers of """"WE"""" increase the reader's understanding / meet minimal use?
MOS says not to sandwich text between images - this does so in several places.
I read Mosely's biography of Lindbergh years ago (it is cited here) and read WE as a kid. This seems to me to under play Lindbergh's isolationism and at least the perception of him as an appeaser / possible Nazi sympathizer. 
The language in the lead at least seems needlessly convoluted - look at what the page Lindbergh says """"Charles Lindbergh (1902–1974), first pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic"""" then look at how it described here """"As a 25-year-old U.S. Air Mail pilot Lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, made from Roosevelt Field[N 1] located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km), in the single-seat, single-engine purpose built Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis."""" The facts are all there, but it is so comvoluted that if you don't already know what Lindy did, you might miss it.
What makes """"Charleslindberg.com a reliable source? See WP:RS

I have come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is no different than any other source of misinformation. My intentions of contributing to the Whitman article was due to my involvement with the officer who killed Whitman and numerous victims, professors, witnesses and news media outlets. But Alas, I find myself, as Gulliver, lost among a few Yahoos whose intentions appear to be to their own speculation and interpretation of Charles Whitman and The University of Texas Tower Tragedy. Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions. I will take away all my contributions. I realize they will be re-inserted for the Yahoos benefit, but that will be out of my hands!

Hello Mabdul,
I'm sorry to inform you that I have closed your RFA as unsuccessful. I arrived at this result based on community concerns related to your activities on IRC and during April 1st. People felt that actions you took in those settings evidenced immaturity and were likely to conflict with the expectations the community has for administrators to be capable of complex and sensitive discretionary decisions. However, I should also note that many commentors did view your administrative potential positively and there was overwhelming approval of your contributions to the project as an editor. I would suggest that your review the feedback in the RFA and consider running in some months after reflection on how you can better handle borderline situations that could result in controversy.

I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.

You seem to be arguing that wikipedia should categorize this article as """"mythology"""", because your source is that Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes """"Leviathan"""" as mythology.  The multiple logical fallacies here should be apparent.  Getting back on topic, there are numerous religious organizations with hundreds of millions of followers that teach the Tower of Babel was a historical event, and you are also arguing that their point of view should not be respected, beause apparently you think you have found some kind of superior knowledge to them to be able to state that it was not a historical event.   But wikipedia should be neutral, and should not use such biased and non-neutral language to take sides and declare any one scripture to be """"mythology"""", your own pov notwithstanding.  It must not take any stand whatsoever on whether it is historical or mythological, but should just present all the evidence and let readers make up their own mind instead of trying to make it up for them.  Your attempts to use wikipedia as a platform for pushing one pov against another are going to be resisted.  By the way, it might be more to the point if you can find an Encyclopedia that calls """"Tower of Babel"""" mythology, not Leviathan.

Erm, to clarify, I didn't say that Punic and Greek warships can be handled together as Hellenistic warships, I merely said that they are usually handled together as belonging to the same chapter in maritime technology. You can check Meijer, the Cambridge history, Casson or Morrison and Coates. In all of them, the warships of the 4th to 1st centuries BC are handled together, whether they were of Punic or Greek type, which is quite natural, as explained above. For the Hellenistic , I agree it is not very accurate, but Morrison at least has written a chapter """"Hellenistic Oared Warships, 399–31 BC"""" in AGE OF THE GALLEY in which he includes both Western and Eastern Mediterranean ships. Perhaps a more accurate title for our article would be """"Hellenistic-era warships"""" which emphasizes the period and not the culture? Given that the Hellenistic era lasted all the way to the battle of Actium, it would also fit the article's scope.    ✍  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Funny thing is though, when he decides he's a victim of it he runs, crying like a toddler who's just dropped his ice-cream, to the """"notice board"""", demanding people be banned. He's always telling others how to behave, but he doesn't think the rules apply to him. Self-esteem problems.

 ==Lies and more lies from an unstable admin== 

Totally, completely untrue.
If you examine the history and comments I've left, you'll see that the few people who are responsible for warring on my contributions have routinely vandalized and destroyed my legitimate contributions, while for the most part when I've reverted to my versions I've usually tried to respectfully retain the valuable additions and changes they've made.
Also, universally recongnized FACTS DO NOT require """"sourcing"""" and links. EVERYONE in New York State KNOWS as FACT that Deborah Glick favors big-government solutions, high-tax/high-spend policies, is against ALL citizens having ANY Self-Defense Rights involving gun ownership, believes that ONLY police should have all the guns, and that all her economic policies, which she CLAIMS are to """"help"""" the """"disadvantaged and poor"""", FLY IN THE FACE of accepted economic LAW.

Now, I guess you do have the temporary power to disable me, but you'll only be furthher discrediting YOURSELF. Even the Wikipedia Administrators who have complained to me about my reverts and re-edits have admitted and openly SAID that ANYONE has the right to edit ANY page, as long as they do not violate the 3-Revert-24 Rule; if you care, go back and review where they said that multiple times.

I have every right to edit any article at least once per day; and my posts consist mainly of ADDITIONS to articles, not deleting portions of other people's contributions. All of my contributions involve generally adding additional information, opposing viewpoints and the pewrspective of critics; ALl my opponents edits consist of deleting my contributions and trying to silence my participation here.

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

I could never be humiliated or embarrassed by a small person like you; administrators of your ilk have already demonstrated that you would be better taking kindergarten and grammar school over again than trying to manage and lead other people who have achieved adulthood long ago.

f987a146fc071c1c,"""A shared working relationship and agenda, limited actual knowledge of the subject in this case and unfortunately no desire to seriously discuss how much to highlight an obscure thesis. Of course. Best to just put NPOV tag on the article because consensus is impossible. Not that the Edwards reference concerns me much. 

There is a published view that Advaita and """"enlightenment"""" itself is a fraud created by possession by power hungry beings, specifically referencing Ramana Maharshi. That view deserves equal treatment as far as being referenced. To quote the author: 

Consider this quote by the currently popular guru, Ramana Maharshi: “Repetition aloud of His name is better than praise. Better still is its faint murmur. But the best is repetition within the mind — and that is meditation. Better than such broken thought is its steady and continuous flow like the flow of oil or of a perennial stream.”

Ramana Maharshi’s statement represents mantra meditation’s goal: a state where the mind is timelessly identified with surrender to the name of one’s god – identical with the god himself. The mind itself has become self-negation at the feet of the deity. Empty of original thought and dynamic desire, the “liberated” person’s ego is dissolved: the very thing that made him or her human. All that is left is a mind-body shell, a meat-robot, that moves through life as a surrendered instrument of some greater will. I suggest the greater will is not that of the Infinite. It is the will of the god who has taken the place of one’s mind...

Does this sound like possession? It surely appears to be. Think of all the gurus you’ve met with their palpable shakti. An energy so real no one who experiences it can deny it. What is that light in their eye, a light beyond this world? Whose is that power they touch you with, embrace you with? Is it the shakti of Brahman, the light of pure consciousness? Or is it the power of Kali or one of her friends? Gurus often say they are the embodiment of Shiva, Kali, or some other god. Why do we not take them at their word?

I would like to suggest that mantra meditation turns humans into zombies who serve the agenda of the gods. That agenda is procurement of more humans and more human energy. This explains the common phenomenon of proselytizing by the religious, including fundamentalist Christians, TMers, and disciples of other varieties. Servants of “God” or the gods feel a driving need to bring in more recruits. The god that moves through them fills them with this zeal, as a hungry stomach fills the mind with an overwhelming need to procure dinner.

There are no gods, in the sense the gods would have us think of them. No one has been designated by the Infinite to control creation and administer the laws of nature. The sun shines by itself as an entity with its own consciousness. The rain and wind don’t need a god to direct them; they move where they will in harmony with their fellow elements. All things are children of the Infinite, spirits or egos in their own unique right, expressing in physical form and also in astral dimensions.

The gods are spirits/egos like everybody else. Most of the time they dwell on astral planes, which is why human senses normally don’t perceive them. According to ancient records, they have visited the earth in ages past in physical forms of their own, as entities from the stars.

They are no more divine than a ghost, no more cosmic than you or I, and no more entitled or intended to run the universe than any other gang of warlords might be. Somehow they’ve gained control of this planet, and have held that control at least since the beginning of recorded human history. But that is no reason to think the Infinite wants it that way, or that life needs to continue that way.

True empowerment is not the Indian concept of enlightenment. It is knowing what we are and living from there. We are spirit: individual and eternal, moving within the consciousness of That which created, sustains and pervades all life. Knowing this is not difficult. It only requires putting attention on that which is beneath the content of thought. Acting from this place of empowerment is natural: we can ordain reality from that quantum level. Everyone can do it. Everyone is equally powerful moving and creating in the depths of their own consciousness.

Unfortunately, people rarely do that, though, as the mass hypnosis that governs human life convinces us that karma, fate or the will of God runs the world, that we as individuals have little direct control over what happens to us. The gods are the purveyors of this global hypnosis. It serves their agenda of control. True liberation does not mean rising above the illusion of ourselves as egos. It means rising above the illusion that as egos we are cut off from the powerhouse of creation. That as individuals we are something less t",0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a very simple non-issue. Bagramyan enlisted into the DRA army and fought within its ranks in very crucial (and famous to Armenians) battles against the invading Turks. When you join an army, you are going to fight by its side which Bagramyan did, especially during that time when the Turks were a few km away from Yerevan. The battles (especially Sardarabad) were battles that would determine life or death of the newly established republic. What he joined, became or did after or during the fall of the DRA has nothing to do with what he did prior to it.

 About Corticopia 

Corticopia's past 

Hello:

I just want to share with you some information you might consider important. We had a very difficult time months ago removing Mexico from Central America in the article North America. Why? Because an """"anonimous"""" user (IP from Toronto Canada) was reverting all the changes. I finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry. One month later, I found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account.

Well my point is that he is against of Mexico being included in North America. His main """"argument"""" was that the UN geosheme includes Mexico in CA and that's it. He also denies that North America is also a subregion of America and ignores the cited content proving him wrong. Well, he is Corticopia. For months he was retired and trust me, NO BODY changed the articles North America and Central America (specially this one) to say Mexico was in CA.

Suddenly a """"new"""" user shows up. He deleted a line in the article CA. It said """"Mexico is rarely, yet sometimes included in Central America under certain definitions"""". This line was discussed and agreed. He changed it to """"Mexico is included in Central America"""" then to """"Mexico is sometimes included in Central America"""".

I don't know what his problem is. The important thing is I totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago, so I checked his edit list. Wow! What a discovery, his first edit was the article Issac Asimov and articles about Canada and some other regions of the world. It was very obvious it was the same person. Please check this sources  and this . Please, read them carefully.

Please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account, specially the one of User:Ex post factoid. It is very obvious he is the same person.

He was dragged into the article Mexico when he was unable to """"win"""" again in the article Central America (he didn't even try to change the article North America because he knows a lot of people guard that article). So his reason to say Mexico is in """"Southern North America"""" are purely false and personal. He wants to """"exclude"""" Mexico or make it """"look"""" appart from Canda and the USA.

I'm telling you this because I think you don't realize his reasons are just personal, a personal aversion against Mexico being included in North America. If he's so interested in accuracy of the articles, why isn't he editing the article USA? He even asked Supaman to do it by himself. He's just there to exclude Mexico. Please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case. You said that you're an administrator in Spanish Wikipedia, so I think you're experienced in these cases. You will find it is the same person. Cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did. Too bad I warned him and I'm sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified. I think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased, excluding information, even if sourced, because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy.

Hi Legolas95, thank you for acknowledging my concern;
In etymology section, user:sitush has previously suggested while replying to another user - to restore the previous content excluding Sadasivan's book reference.  The concerned sentence from this reference was self-explanatory and was not inclined to any side as to why the term Nayar is derived from Naagar.  Please consider the following point also that the Naga point of etymology was not given consideration because of misinterpretation that real serpents have evolved to constitute Nair population - which is entirely false.  I was really mentioning this census report shall stand as an authentic reference for the same.
My second humble suggestion was to consider the caste system in the article.  I would like to invite your attention to the first sentence ie.
""""The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy and in that system outranked even the kings.""""
This sentence at the beginning says about the role of Namboodiri class in Kerala as a whole.  This is not about Nairs or the caste system of nairs.  Here the proposed sentence gives little light on the scene ie.
""""Nairs observed no internal caste system till the Brahmin migration occurred in Kerala.""""
This is not promotional to nairs but it indirectly says Brahmin migration has influenced Nair caste system.  My kind opinion is that it is better to remove present first sentence.
Second sentence says,
""""Bulk of them formed the fighting and protecting class, some of whom became chiefs and Naduvazhis. Some sections of the people were engaged in other occupations also.""""
This actually represent all sides of the community.  Tell me if this sentence seems inclined certainly we shall remove this.
The third sentence I consider as little important:  It says,
""""It is a notable point that long before Aryans migrated southwards, Nairs had travelled far beyond the northern tradition of chathurvarna system and developed a multiplicity of castes.""""
This sentence actually demonstrates that Nair community's social structure is prone to faster development.

I have a request to user:Legolas95 user:Sitush and user:Qwyrxian - In the reference under consideration, there is a sentence claiming that 'there is no evidence that before 18th century (before 1700 AD) the term sudra was ever applied to Nairs.'  If this like a sentence requires verification, we need to consider references created before this period.  What in my mind is that if we be little flexible on the matter of older reference - it can help Nair article.    

These were my concerns regarding this census report which are quite eligible to be considered and provides some help towards improvement in the article.    19:27""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism 

The article currently says, 
The Economist in an article writes that some Uruguayans see him as """"a roly-poly former guerrilla who grows flowers on a small farm and swears by vegetarianism"""", but he is not vegetarian.

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle. The claim contradicts statements made in the article's more neutral sources, including the BBC source, which calls him """"the vegetarian Mujica"""". Following the usage guidelines for biographies of living persons, I've removed this claim. 

If a native Spanish speaker can provide further guidance about the source, we can move forward with verifying this claim.

Julien, there always exist contrary points of view. People still take issue with the Earth being round. But while one can have a contrary opinion, that doesn't make said opinion a fact. 

Gaywebmonkey has cited its sources  an interview with Corrigan, published comments by Cobra's attorney's, email correspondence between Corrigan and an unnamed producer, and statements by various anti-child porn groups.  The issue isn't those sources. It's the fact that you haven't provided one source for anything you've contributed to the article. 

I've changed your """"claiming"""" comments  to """"stating."""" """"Claiming"""" is far less neutral than """"stating."""" You are arguing the article was biased. I was rectifying that situation. None of which prohibits another party with knowledge of the issues in question from stating the opposite  as Cobra's attorneys have done.  But just changing """"stated"""" to """"claims"""" doesn't make something """"more"""" neutral.

Lastly, the reason why citation is so important here is to allow anyone else to backtrack and read for themselves about the issues in question. It brings a measure more of impartiality to the proceedings. The rules here are the same for you as they are for me: cite your sources.

One more thought on this topic, which I think is very important. Although I instinctively feel All Blacks should be the name for this page, there is a real difference between the two names - the All Blacks aren't only, as  Cvene64 stated, """"the New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV"""". The All Blacks were [until very recent tours] also the team which played non-international games on tour. Hence Zinzan Brooke, for example, has played 58 times [58 tests] for 'the New Zealand national team', and another 42 for the All Blacks. A quick look at the official All Blacks site  shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match.

As the 2 names are not exactly equivalent, I have to agree with GordyB and Duncharris that strictly speaking we should not use All Blacks as the main name for this article. 13:13, 4 September""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Beginner questions 

Is gene therapy supposed to affect the whole body, or is it supposed to only affect those cells where it is neccessary (e.g. some gene defect causing gastrointestinal problems only requires gene therapy in the gastrointestinal tract)?
Do cells treated with gene therapy participate in mitosis? Will copies of treated cells have the same treated DNA?
Is it required to constantly get gene therapy to keep the desired result, or is the purpose that once cells are treated the therapy is self-sustaining?
Is there a """"combat""""/""""balance"""" between non-treated cells and treated cells? Are genetically-treated bodies technically Chimera (genetics)?
Does gene therapy have the target to completely transform the DNA of the patient?

just a clarification: some forms of religion are empirical, they simple use standards of evidence different than those used for scientific purposes.  Scientific investigation is intentionally designed with a very restrictive set of legitimate forms of observation, and takes a conservative stance that makes no claims which cannot be demonstrated from inside that set.  there are people on both sides of the fence who abuse that process (non-scientists who make positive claims that cannot be justified within the conservative limitations of science, and skeptics who make negative claims that cannot be justified within the conservative limitations of science). Science is good at what it does, but very easy to abuse for other purposes.  Ludwigs2 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia of any entry is  verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. Wikipedia:Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's core content policies, along with Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in Wikipedia articles. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore familiarize themselves with all three. If your claim is true with the birthpalce of Miss Earth Cuba 2009, Jamillette Gaxiola, you shold be able to provide third party verifiable reference (not from myspace, facebook, or blogs). However, I have provided a third party verifiable source as cited in the article and for your perusal here's the link: Miss Cuba 2009 - Jamillette Gaxiola. In the link, it is clearly stated that she was born in Havana, Cuba. Please response in this thread (your talk page) not in my talk page, so there's continuity in our discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The nomination of the article about the London/English riots for deletion is probably the most asinine nomination I have ever encountered in Wikipedia. It is the lead news story for just about every media outlet in the English-speaking world (and most of the rest of the world). During the worst rioting, many news organisations have devoted their programming to provide on-going coverage of the riots as they take place. Even New Zealand's media is reporting on the riots, and our media is utter CRAP (car crashes, weather, sport and some stupid item about a cute animal in a zoo). 's initial nomination for deletion was idiotic. But, his continued obsession with deleting the article, in the face of overwhelming opposition from the general Wikipedia community, clearly constitutes disruptive behaviour and hints at his own mental health issues.

I did not set that the proportion justifies any killing. I am just interested in accentuate that for the whole WW II and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is Nazi Germany. There was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion. Also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. To clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited. Many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge. When you take for consideration that every one of fifth Polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether. Now I hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs. Uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those. Feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations.

With accusation you must be very specific. I understand and accepted the consideration about what happen, but be specific. Be very specific, and do not forget that """"first thing must be put first"""". The story is regarding nations rather then individuals. In this case you judge Polish people etc. versus German people. One can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity. However imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation. He was attacked, bitten almost killed. He lost his eye and arm. And now his neighbor says: the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal.

The guy says, but I was attacked and I lost his arm and my eye. Never mine the neighbor says: this is a crime to hit somebody. _  I know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals, but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject """"B"""" arrogantly forgetting about the subject """"A"""".

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0,0,0,0,0,0

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true.

 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0,0,0,0,0,0

The book states; The discrepencies in eyewitnesses evidence were substancial and wide-ranging. Each of the fourteen eyewitnesses testified different accounts of what they saw. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing smoke coming from Ryan's rifle, although it was established by an expert on forensic ballistics Senior Sergeant Colin Letherbarrow, who testified that the cartridges used were of a smokeless variety. (Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

Hi Tim, 

What does your schedule look like in the near future?  We should probably start to sketch plans for the workshop, and to draft a new description for Alison.  I made a subpage as a central place for us and other interested Wikipedians to plan the workshop.  I threw out some basic ideas there, but they might be terribly obvious to you and other experienced Wikipedians.  I also contacted  and , two Wikipedians I met at Wikimania, to ask for their help and advice.  I might begin writing up a tutorial for newbie scientists, but as a newbie scientist myself, I'll definitely need your help with that.  If possible, I'd like to get most of the workshop organized by the beginning of September, since I have a significant teaching load next semester.  Regards,",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""Internet spam is equally common in the modern age, however publicly declaring people, website or company's of spamming is illegal and is classed as defamation. There has been much debate that Wikipedia is in breach of the law with their spam project. Whereby Wikipedia lists apparent spam websites.

 Islamic Science 

There's been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science.  At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.

There's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.

 The article """"Islamic science"""" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called """"Islamic science,"""" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines """"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context"""" (my emphasis).

 Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.

These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:

 When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion. 

 When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures. 

Rather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me. Go back to being a Jew-wannabe sweety. Jews are white, not black. Remember that too- that's why you're not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish.

I'm doing something over on WWE Championship and the champions' list to make a point.  If what you believe I am proposing here with Daniel Bryan is WP:Crystal, then the entire current WWE Championship scenario is also WP:Crystal, and we don't even have a verified idea as to who is WWE Champion is or what the valid lineage is at all.  For the same reason, is the """"vacation"""" and tournament similarly WP:Crystal, especially given some very real storyline questions which were never really addressed?  This is why you default back to what I stated when I quoted you Wikipedia's own """"not a crystal ball"""" situation.  Under your guise of WP:Crystal, not only do you reverse any mention of Miz/Mysterio, you must also reverse everything which was announced on the 7/18 RAW, including the title strippage!  But then is CM Punk even the champion at all, given several factors in the storyline going back to the """"worked shoot"""" promo?  If you want to open a WP:Crystal can of worms, then pro wrestling is a very bad place to be following announced events here on Wikipedia!

This permits a lot of redundant computation to be eliminated,  and the algorithm parallelized.  If f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial and p,q,r,s are root approximations, the approximated polynomial is (x-p)(x-q)(x-r)(x-s) and its derivative at p is (p-q)(p-r)(p-s) so a Durand-Kerner iteration for p would be p = p - f(x)/((p-q)(p-r)(p-s)) and iterations of identical form for q, r, and s follow immediately.

Then take it out if you want.  This is a very popular article that is attracting many vandals, several of whom have changed other stuff I put in it.  I told you three times that I watched this television segment.  I did not read a summary of it in a book or magazine.  I saw and heard it.  I remember what Janis' parents were wearing and what their eyeglass frames were like.  I did not tell the reader to go to the library in Baltimore.  I said there is a 16 millimeter film copy of it there, which doesn't mean it's the only library that has it.  It could be in a lot of libraries.  

Since you evidently never have been to the Baltimore library, then don't assume it has a """"card/computer entry.""""  I checked out the reel of 16 millimeter film in 1984 after finding the title """"Janis Joplin"""" in the film catalog.  I told the film clerk (it wasn't a librarian) that I wanted to check out that title, and he returned with it a few minutes later.  All he needed was the title.  I supplied the 16 millimeter projector, which I no longer own.  (Do YOU know anyone who owns one ?)  Several years later (1992), I heard a radio interview with Janis' sister Laura, promoting her book Love, Janis, in which a phone caller asked her if she recalled that 60 Minutes segment from shortly after Janis' death.  Laura corrected him, saying it came from a primitive NBC news magazine show titled """"First Tuesday.""""  I will try to split up those footnotes, but I can't guarantee it.  This article is so popular that I could be 90 percent done with typing the changes and then the system tells me I am in an """"edit war.""""  The next time that happens, I am going to give up and let people assume that Janis, like everyone else who used hard drugs in the late 1960s, was a lot like a """"Dragnet"""" character, and her parents were that dumb, too.  I will stick with her music. You can make friends by talking about someone's music, but not by talking about First Tuesday.   dooyar""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

I propose to remove the following sentence from the Definition sub-paragraph in the article: """"Economists usually follow Cagan’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%."""" or replace it with: A handful of economists still follow Cagan´s descpription that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%. 

The generally accepted definition regarding hyperinflation is the IASB´s definition, namely, 100% cumulative inflation over three years. It is the definition followed by all accountants worldwide and by the far greater majority of economists. Only a small handful of economists follow Cagan´s definition. No government follows Cagan´s definition: thus, it is a fact that no macroeconomist advising any government follows Cagan´s definition.

I don't think it a controversial fact, but you have a valid point. Without a source(trust me, there really isn't one) on immigrants to the Unites States from the rather newly independent nation state of Azerbaijan, it is best to leave it out.

Pigeon-holing them with predominantly anything needs a clear source, and as such the data appears lacking.

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

 2) I accept that this point is correct, however, the article mentions that """"Creationist beliefs may be based on creationist theology, creation science, or a combination of both"""" therefore making this criticism completely relevant to the article. Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, """"Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.""""
3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution. While this may appear to be in the interests of NPOV, the reality is that the actual evidence for evolution is so hugely overwhelming, that to give an impression of equal validity is itself a bias point. Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article. I accept that an argument putting forward the 'credentials' of creationism is fair and should be included, but the argument against it should not be tamed in to give the ostensible appearance of neutrality.  17:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself. """"Sinusoids"""" is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT, so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance, cleaning your shit is what it is.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Requesting information on a banned user 

Dear Mr. Chapman:

I write to you to request information regarding the blocking/banning of User:Mr Spunky Toffee, sockpuppet of User:Brian G. Crawford.  I ask because I had a run-in with him a couple of months ago, in which he attempted to delete a page I had written and insulted me repeatedly.  I was intrigued (but not altogether surprised) to discover a few days ago that he had been blocked as a sock-puppet, but I do know that he had a long history of personal attacks on other users.

What I would like to know is, what was it that got Brian G. Crawford banned from Wikipedia in the first place?  He is not listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users, nor is he included in the Category:Banned Wikipedia users.  His user page states that """"This user is banned from all Wikimedia projects by order of the Foundation.""""  But, the Wikipedia:Banning policy page states that """"The Wikimedia Foundation has the authority to ban users, though it has not exercised this authority on the English Wikipedia.""""

So frankly, I am a bit confused as to what went on here, which is why I am asking you, as you are the one who discovered that Mr Spunky Toffee was Crawford's sockpuppet.  I will understand if this information is confidential or otherwise unavailable; if this is the case please let me know on my talk page.  Or, if you would rather talk to me in private (by e-mail or otherwise), let me know and I would be happy to accommodate you.

Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active?

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things?

Fair use rationale for Image:Kingbooker.jpg

This file may be deleted.
Thanks for uploading Image:Kingbooker.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday

Since his later edits, including signing up for the WikiCup with the al-Qaeda flag, demonstrated that he was here to troll, I blocked him indefinitely. Enter , who, within two minutes of creating his account, is able to perform an intricate template time update on a nomination by . Note the interest in Wikipedia:Featured pictures shared by all three accounts. Nick then posts to Masem's talkpage, linking this vandalized version of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wagner and identifying Pirated as a sock of Wagner. In that vandalized revision, note that the vandalism included references to Montenegro. Pirated, after being reverted for attempting to use the al-Qaeda flag, requested to use the Podgorica flag. Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro. At this point, H.W.C. complained that I am """"blocking users with little evidence and expecting people to clean up the rest after him again"""" (emphasis mine). Note the use of """"again"""", when I have never interacted with him under that account before.

Additionally, note that H.W.C. created his account and immediately started making featured picture nominations centering around video games. Wagner has occasionally talked about being a video gamer to his own socks. Additionally, H.W.C. signed up for the WikiCup with a Montenegro flag, which he later changed to the Podgorica flag. He clones 's userbox and adds another of Mason's userboxes to his userpage. Mason Doering is a known sock of Wagner.

Nick's modifications to the template were on a nomination created by H.W.C. On Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/File:Poolside 03.jpg, H.W.C. showed up in twenty minutes to comment on Pirated's nomination. H.W.C., Mason Doering, and Pirated use similar edit summary styles.

I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, """"that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""", taken from Quigley's """"The Case for Palestine"""" (p. 162). Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel. In light of this I am deleting the sentence from the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1,0,0,0,0,0

First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

Mr. N, please accept my apology, for my rude language, bad attitude, and short temper. For what its worth, Respect is due for your contributions to Wikipedia, and your intelligence, as clearly made evident by your work. I do not believe there is any excuse for my rude behavior, particularly on article's and their parts, nor any personal references I have made towards you at all.  I also understand that """"My"""" personal point of view, what ever it is on what ever topic, should not be reflected in the article because I think so.

Clearly, my post, that I think has started this dispute(About evolution and big bang and imago de, still fairly posted), was spread to far, and/or not worded right. I do understand it is my job to post the right questions in the right places. 

You are the first editor to take any time with me. I see that, and I see that we do not agree on many interpretations of things. I like this.

Forgive my lack of experience, I feel new. My first edit(HC way back when) rash, and I had thought that commonly accepted applied to recent events. I am learning and apologize if it has been seen as wasting your time. 

I have added a few accepted edits. I am particularly proud of my change to Sin, the sub section header, Etymology, as opposed to the prier History of the word.

And to Mythology. I Do like this Topic(I am a Christian).

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,

 some advice 

hi Hboetes.   You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"body of law"""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"wikilawyering"""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"reliable"""" and """"NPOV"""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Saying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs.  Not one source is a blog.  The New York Sun, USA Today, Frontpage Magazine, Florida International University, History News Network, and the Independent Research Institute...ARE NOT BLOGS.  Canderra is just making up excuses to delete information he does not like and the leftists sycophants are working to have me blocked while ignoring Canderra's (and others) abuses.

Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.

Thanks for your contribution to this article, but by longstanding consensus operating systems that use the Linux kernel are called """"Linux"""" on Wikipedia, as per WP:COMMONNAME. """"GNU/Linux"""" is considered a minority POV term used by the FSF and its supporters. On Wikipedia the term is only used to describe distros when the distro itself is called """"GNU/Linux"""" and then only when referring to the distro itself. If you want to change this consensus then the way to go about is not by trying to insert the term GNU/Linux into articles on distributions, such as on Trisquel. You should read Talk:Linux including all the archives of that page, to get the history of the problem as well as Talk:Linux/Name as this is where past consensuses have been formed. You will also want to read GNU/Linux naming controversy and its talk page as background as well. When you have the history of the consensus read then you can present your case at Talk:Linux to try to convince the other editors that all references """"Linux"""" other than to the kernel itself in Wikipedia should be changed to """"GNU/Linux"""". Be advised that this has been brought up dozens of times there, including recently and has always been soundly and conclusively opposed. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:
Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: """"What is your name?"""" The princess replied: """"The daughter of Jahan-shah"""". Ali said: """"and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called"""" (""""the bride of the land"""").

Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of """"land/country and city"""" for """"shahr""""?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   06:52, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society. At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance.

 Final Edit 

Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.

The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking """"buh-bye"""" commentary.

Eric Hoffer wrote, """"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.""""  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a """"non-notable"""" and a """"vanity"""" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.

It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.

In On Friendship and On Beauty Bacon addresses male love, or 'masculine love' as he significantly terms it in New Atlantis. Male love can obviously be platonic, but the term was also employed by the earliest writers who self-identified as what we now term homosexual, so it adds to the supporting evidence.

However, would please stop making statements such as """"dismissed out of hand as drama"""", which, when taken with Pete's comments elsewhere, is starting to make this look like a concerted effort on the part of multiple editors to enforce consensus through insulting and attacking one side, rather than presenting good arguments, which doesn't tie in with your comments further above about trying to prevent that.

 Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde 

You are right, nothing official was said.
But, thinking like this, we would say Arankaru and not Arrancar, right? But we use Arrancar because that's a word.
The same goes to Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde. Adjuchas I can't recall precisely now, but is a kind of monster similar to the illustration we saw when Hitsugaya talked about the Ajuukasu. About Vasto Lorde, as you ar aware, means """"Vast Lord"""" in English.
I choose the spanish romanization because, if it was Vast Lord, the word wouldn't be vastoroode, but vastoroodo.
I just changed the names because I know we are always trying to use the real words instead of the raw kana reading. And Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde are the only """"real"""" romanization I ever saw to Ajuukasu and Vastoroodo. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 

Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   
I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello,
I did not remove your addition of phrase Hebrew phrase """"Israel HaShlema"""", I merely added back-in the link to the Wikipedia Greater Israel article. That phrase is English, and this is the English edition of Wikipedia. 

Coverage on Wikipedia should not make a subject appear more notable than it actually is. The phrase Greater Israel returns 607,000 pages on Google, and about 16,500 references in Google Books. Eretz Israel Hashlema only returns 361 web pages and 84 references in Google Books. In order to be notable enough to appear in Wikipedia, an idea should be referenced extensively, and Greater Israel is obviously very common terminology that belongs in the list.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Chick Flick 
I disagree with the definition of """"Chick Flick"""" and have issue with it, partly of personal definition and somewhat justifiably as it is uncited. """"Chick Flick"""" is not simply about the popularity with women but with women as a target audience and not necessary a """"romance"""" or have romance as a main theme (learned in school, looking for reference). Just think of the more recent """"chick flicks"""" like Boys on the Side (arguably about failing romance but the uniting theme is their friendship), Thelma and Louise (again, female """"partners in crime""""), Riding in Cars With Boys (despite the title, the larger theme is her relationship with her father and her son, not just her boyfriend/husband), and The Women (female friendships where only one friend is truly affected by her -lack of- romantic relationship with her husband). 

I'm not ready to remove it yet as currently """"chick flick"""" redirects to a Charmed episode and it deserves a mention somewhere else.

Hi. ) I got a bit distracted there; I wanted to see if I could find his books. He's allowed to upload a self-portrait (sometimes people claim studio pictures are self-portraits, but I bet this one really is), but """"used with permission"""" is not going to cut it from a licensing standpoint. ) My guess would be that he's trying to address the licensing requirements set out at his talk page but doesn't understand them.

Due to things off my hands, (appointments, car broken, my neighbor is not legal so she chose not to go because Arpaio allegedly threatened to arrest illegals, only small groups gathered here) and just plain bad luck I wasn;'t able to march but I protested too, wearing White that day and resisting my ever attacking urges to shop and shop, which are like the munchies to me. Today Im already looking forward to what Im gonna buy tonight..lol!!

Anyways, banderas arriba!! We gotta peacefully fight the racists, show them we are here to stay. Spain's and Chile's consulate urged their citizens to protest, and I saw Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chilean, Venezuelan and Salvadorean flags on the march when I looked at the news. Aquel vato from Walkout! said """"what a beautiful day to be a Chicano!"""" I kept thinking about those words on May 1, what a beautiful day to be Hispano. 

Im getting a book, Growing up Chicano...have you read it? How good is it? I want to get the entire Hispanic experience in me, not just the Puerto Rican-Caribbean Hispanic experience and to be honest if it was Growing up Bolivian or Spainard Id buy it too, but I cant wait til I read this book Growing up Chicano.

I am not taking advice from either of you.  This is a conversation between me and the administrator. The only problem I see is that obnoxious and confrontational editors like Verbal are given free reign, and in the process they drive other editors off the site.  I've offered my advice:  (1) stop valuing the input of Wiki-addicts like Verbal, and start valuing the input of productive editors; (2) place a daily limit on the number of posts to discourage Wiki-addiction; and (3) ask editors not to make extensive edits to subjects they know nothing about.  Until that is done, the warring on Wikipedia will continue, and knowledgeable editors will continue to be driven off the site  and the articles will suffer.  23:03",0,0,0,0,0,0

Adoption?
Would you be interested in adopting me?  I'm not an idiot.  I can find things myself, usually.  I could use a helping hand occasionally. 

I was a bit confused about notability because there are a lot of seemingly non-notable articles.  I then spent some time at AFD and gave my opinion early to see if it matched the later consensus opinion.  I think I have a better idea about that subject.  This is an example of how I became less of an idiot and how I won't depend on you for everything.
 

Is Brixton Busters really a new editor?

I also note that that BB has chosen to ignore the question - as is BB's right and as should you if you have no light to shed on the answer to this pertinent question (raised not by me, but by Domer48's wrongful assertion that I was being impolite to a new editor.)...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello Rigadoun, your query raises a puzzle for which I would welcome your input.

I'm sure we agree that editing without a reference source is a terrible idea, and articles should have lots and lots of in-line references to indicate where all the material came from.

But what if all the material comes from one single reference source?  In such a case, I could, in principle, add a footnote to every sentence, which would cite the very same source.  But this seems a little bit inelegant and reader-unfriendly to me.  I felt it better simply to declare, once and for all, that everything in the article came from the same source.  Yours sincerely,

Although Allmusic says that the song """"became a hit on British and U.S. R&B; charts"""", there is no evidence that, in fact, it was a hit.  Joel Whitburn's Top R&B; Singles 1942-1995, covering the Billboard R&B; chart in detail, does not mention it at all.  It may have been mentioned in Cash Box, but their charts seem to be unobtainable.  And, though there may have been some """"R&B;"""" charts published in some UK music magazines, I can't track any down.  So, at best we should downplay the fact that it was a hit, when actually we don't have the evidence that it was.  Good record though.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem is not only with the sections concerning """"Controversy about media coverage"""", the major problem is that many major points about the Greek debt crisis are missing in the lead and the article, even though it consists of >100 pages. This is addressed in 
 section #4 - """">100 pages, but still main points missing?""""
 section #5 - """" Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis? """"
 section #6 -  """" POV / LEAD debate """"
Two weeks ago, I proposed in this section #4 to have the main points at least in summary style in the lead (as important ones are not even in the article)
Just let's only take the first point listed in #4, being joining the Euro without sufficient financial convergence and competitiveness in the summary list of causes for the Greek debt crisis. It is the major single and early root cause for the Greek debt crisis. Without this root cause Greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma. But this cause is missing in the 100 WP pages and in the WP lead. The current lead only lists normal problems like """"structural weaknesses"""" and """"recessions""""  (even though it is clear that Greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed) - so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the Greek debt crisis.
What happened after I proposed to have the main points in the article (at least in the lead as a summary) and also invited everybody to add/change/delete from my proposed the main point list? There were strong opponents working in a coordinated action, threatening to fight any significant change, saying one can not summarize a Greek debt crisis, saying """"Greek interests [need to have] a prominence"""") when describing the debt crisis in WP, saying they will not let other editors summarize it, and so on. So we have almost 100 new pages in the talk section, and main points about the lemma not in the article (like it was during the last 5 years)

 Changes between editions 

I AM QUOTING the current wording of the section: """"Changes between editions""""

""""Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church, Jerald and Sandra Tanner have claimed to have documented almost 4000 changes in the Book of Mormon.[37] The vast majority of these changes have been discussed in official Church publications ....""""

The part """"Former Mormons, and now critics of the LDS church,"""" was just added and it raises a question in my mind.

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

 Episode review MFD 

I've moved some stuff around and started to set up the review process to work more like WP:RM, where discussions would be held on the article talk namespace (in this case, a parent article such as a list of, etc). You had mentioned that it would be a big improvement, and so I was wondering if this would change your support regarding deletion. Even if it is not perfect right now, there is a need for something other than AfDs to handle these articles, and this is a process that will only continue to improve. If something doesn't make sense, we'll change it. If people are being excluded, we'll change it. But being sniped before we have a chance to develop the process is like getting the ground pulled from under you.

Gibraltar
Hello Woohookitty,

User Ecemaml has told us to ask you for help with a problem me and a number of users, including Ecemaml, have had with the article on Gibraltar. Perhaps you could provide some form of arbitration. There is no particular dispute at this moment although over the past few months, user Gibnews has imposed his POV version of the article on the vast majority of users. Other opinions backed with acceptable sources are dismissed by him as pro-Spanish. He also seems to convey a sense of irrational hostility towards Spain and Spaniards which are reflected in his edits. If you check the history of the talk page, he has driven away a number of users over the past few months. He is now engaged in disputes regarding articles on """"San Roque"""" and """"Algeciras"""" (cities close to the British territory of Gibraltar.) Permanently banned user """"Gibraltarian"""" has recently returned to support him as an unregistered user signing as """"yanito"""". On the other side of the debate, the only user showing a (Pro Spanish POV) tendentious and aggressive behaviour is User Ismael76, although he seems to have got bored of the issue and left the debate.

I was wondering if you could give us some advice on what we should do with Gibnews and the article in general. It is sad when users appropriate articles as their own to express their POVs.

Please have a look at the following:

Some nuances and an unsettled question
I've tried to tone down some statements that seemed to me potentially exaggerated.  For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as """"hyperactive"""" I think fails the POV test). 

I'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch """"resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country"""".  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted """"from"""" the S&Ls;' troubles?  Not my field of specialization: maybe someone else can take a lok at this passage?

Dozens of great jokes and """"Carollaisms.""""  As you can see on this bio page, the Wikiquote link is still at bottom of his own bio article.  Quotes were properly sourced.

The """"Se"""" in """"Sesotho"""" does not mean """"language."""" It is a noun class marker which is an inalienable part of the morphology of the word. That's simply the way the word looks.

For example, """"education"""" is derived from """"educate"""" through a change in morphology. The change implies that the word is a noun, but it is not valid to simply use the root without the suffix.

""""-sotho"""" is a root, which is made meaningful with class markers (Sesotho, Basotho, Lesotho, etc).

I highly doubt that the US gov't is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce (or that it is a world-wide legal requirement to use a US-gov't definition) but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article.  To say that NYMEX has """"no legal right to define measurement units"""" is a bogus argument.  What NYMEX has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade.  If NYMEX states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels, then it is not """"illegal"""" for NYMEX to state the capacity of this thing called a """"barrel"""" in terms of unambiguous STANDARD units, or to point to an authoritative source (authoritative as far as NYMEX is concerned) that defines the capacity of a barrel.

 General editing practice - not about eu-FEDS 

I know I just said """"keep it on the article talk page"""", but I'm going to respond here separately on a couple of things that don't bear directly on that article, to avoid cluttering up that space with things that aren't useful to other editors.

Have you in fact read the Wikipedia guidelines? I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.

First, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to """"reverse the changes"""". There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.

Second, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are """"very logical reasons"""" to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.

Third, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard """"~~~~"""" signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with """":"""" rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I know this topic is on the Jewish Golden age in Spain, so it is natural to see so many Jewish points of view being referenced and linked to. But, this topic is about Jewish Golden age under the Islamic Caliphate in Spain, so there should be some Islamic points of view being linked, if only for the sake of equality in numbers.
However, the majority of historians conclude (at least before the """"War on Terror"""") that the Islamic Caliphate in Spain was very tolerant of Jews and Jewish culture, so again, I would expect that the majority view would be presented as such in the article. As it stands currently, and as someone else mentioned, the article emphasizes the minority and the negatives.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I honestly don't think conspiracy theories are encyclopedical (you will not find them in Britannica, Hispanica, Encarta), and unless clearly identified as such, they violate WP:UNDUE. 
To say that the PSOE backed up the Madrid bombings (which is different from backing the """"turmoil"""", but even that...), even if sourced with a POV reference, is not compliant with the other policies in Wikipedia. """"Good faith"""" has three unavoidable limitations (CITE, OR and NPOV). Remember that what """"rings true"""" or is a """"state of mind"""" based on reports that turned out to be wrong in the end, and cannot be fully verified, cannot be included in Wikipedia. If at all, all sorts of conspiracy theories could be included (and even there I have my reservations) in a very specific article, say 14-M Bombing attacks at Madrid, but not in the general Spain article. 
 It would be similar to including a sentence in the History section of United States saying that the Bush administration was behind the 9/11 attacks, according to some sources. Or, as you know, there are hundreds of conspiracy theories of """"Spain"""" against Catalonia, of which I could find dozens of """"sources"""", some of which, to many people """"ring very true"""", but they are not included in Wikipedia, and probably should not, as you would probably agree.
But I would be more than happy to ask (an) administrator(s) and other users with good-standing for their opinion and/or mediation, if you like.

Whenever anyone states a clearly obvious uncontested fact in Wiki, which is what about 50% of Wiki is, unless someone can show the logical fallacy of the statement being presented as fact, it is usually not removed due to lack of documentation.  For example, if I write that the Dravidian culture of India is centered towards the Southern end of India, I generally won't document it, as it is already a well known fact amongst those who know about India.  Now if I were wrong about this in an article, then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the Dravidian culture is centered in the North of India, and could I please document my claim that it is centered in the South.  But simply to remove without even saying why, that doesn't seem to me to comply with general Wiki practice.

Lede
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede of this article adequately defines the Osvetnik submarine class, establishes the submarine class' necessary context, and explains why this submarine class is otherwise notable. 
 The info box for the submarine class is beautifully formatted and its content is sourced within the prose of the text and by the referenced cited therein.
 As I stated in the articles for the two Osvetnik class submarines, is there no free image of an Osvetnik class submarine for the info box? This is not a deal breaker for GA, but it would certainly add to the article's aesthetics.
 Could one more sentence be added to the lede regarding the distinguishing design features of the Osvetnik class submarines?
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Description and construction
 I suggest starting out the first paragraph of this section by explicitly naming the Osvetnik class.
 While this is a separate matter from this article and its GA qualifications, are there plans in the works to craft an article on the Simonot design?
 Should Maschinenfabrik be spelled out either in parentheses after """"MAN"""" or with """"MAN"""" in parentheses after Maschinenfabrik?
 The section is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Service history
 I suggest adding a comma after """"On 14 September 1943.""""
 On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation, but operation did not proceed. Is this because they were subsequently captured by the Italian XVII Corps? If so, this should be made explicit in the prose.
 There should be a wiki-link to Scuttling in the prose for those readers not familiar with this act of deliberately sinking a ship.

Speedy deletion of Manilla River
 A tag has been placed on Manilla River requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

There doesn't seem too much about druids here.  Yes, the article explains the different shpeshifts fairly indepth, but I think that needs some explaining.  Druids have one of the more richer back stories and lore than any other class and I think that needs to be touched upon.  It seems like whoever wrote the section on druids just did it to get it out of the way so they can talk about how shadow preists are the best at pvp =).  

I'd do it myself but: a.) I don't have any experience writing stuff for wiki, and b.) maybe a more experienced WoW player could write it up better than I could.  If nothing else, I think the shapeshift section could be shortened slightly to make way for more room on lore and Druids in general.

8841f41306f43817,"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

 Editorial issues 

There are points where Highsmith betrays her lack of familiarity with 1980s New York City. I'd like to find a source that comments on this. I find it distracting and careless, and I wonder why her publisher, UK or US, didn't think these things worth fixing. No New Yorker has ever ordered a """"white coffee"""" or handed someone a """"fiver"""" or written """"The Bronx"""" with a capital T. By the 1980s the police were not """"the fuzz"""", even ironically, and Chelsea is Chelsea or perhaps the Chelsea neighborhood, never """"the Chelsea district"""". The video arcade where Ralph works is on Eighth Avenue in the 80s, which doesn't exist, since that's Central Park West. Then, without explanation, it's on Broadway in the 80s. And nowhere in the West 80s would one have found anything like the arcade as described, not even in the 80s when NYC was going through a very rough period.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, I read it, but couldn't see much relevance. I accept your point that my examples were not greatly relevant either. As regards Latin script, a quick shufty at Wiki shows, for example, that the articles on EEK and LTL use the native terms, but the article on the German Mark uses normal EN. Many conclusions are possible here. One could be that currencies we have had extensive contact with get Anglicised (no EN speaker would have said """"50 Mark""""; we pronounced """"francs"""" as if it were an EN word; etc.), but more exotic currencies less so. In spoken use, though, no EN speaker would be capable of saying """"20 santimu"""" - or even """"1 lats"""", as you will surely have noticed. Perhaps a more correct concluusion is that articles written about countries with which most EN speakers have little contact tend to be written by people from those countries, whose mother tongue is not EN (your good self, for example). Still, there it is: EN is the world language and unlike, say, LV, does not belong only to its native speakers. For these reasons, it does not hugely matter what terms this article uses and, although absolutely incompatible with EN, the native terms might well be interesting to any language enthusiasts reading it. I'm backing out on this one.80.187.201.88  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I`ve had to wear a vest and have securities. I`ve had an S.W.A.T. team watch my family because of people who say they support you. I want to show you something that is out on the Internet about me and from people that say they support you.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECK: We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who is joining us tonight for a full hour. I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term """"The Ron Paul Revolution."""" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name. And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip, a very small part of a five- minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed. Can you  would you like to address that at all, sir?

The """"Related controversies"""" section is outrageously biased.

If it's necessary to highlight a link between global warming scepticism and a rejection of peer-reviewed studies of passive smoking and of the role of CFCs in depleting the ozone layer, it's equally necessary to highlight a link between global warming activism and a rejection of peer-reviewed studies of GM foods, whaling, selective logging and the eco-advisibility of scuttling the Brent Spar oil platform - all of which controversies found or find Greenpeace (which for some reason is quoted in this section) on the wrong side of the science.

I believe that free speech and lack of respect for privacy are different issues completely, and one cannot be used to lay into the other. As far as I am aware, the general consensus across many sites is that if you plaster your personal information all over the internet then you have little recourse when it is plastered somewhere you do not like. It is then logical that whoever holds the domain would choose not to release that information as a common sense measure. I think that the idea that ED simply wishes to """"publish all trackable personal data of victims to defame them"""" is a misunderstanding at best and a blatant lie at worst, and the point it (poorly) attempts to make is not worthy of mention in the article.

 Main page appearance: Henry Cornelius Burnett 

This is a note to let the main editors of Henry Cornelius Burnett know that the article will be appearing as today's featured article on January 20, 2012. You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/January 20, 2012. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at all, please ask featured article director  or his delegate , or start a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Today's featured article/requests. If the previous blurb needs tweaking, you might change it—following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. The blurb as it stands now is below:

Henry Cornelius Burnett (1825–1866) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States Senator. He represented Kentucky's 1st congressional district during the lead-up to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress, Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state's support of the Confederacy. He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state. The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond, Virginia to secure Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and briefly served in the Confederate States Army. Burnett's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress, and he was expelled from the House in 1861. After the war, he was indicted for treason, but was never tried. He returned to the practice of law, but died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40. (more...)

I'm talking about its magnitude, not the unimportant linear phase factor.  The symmetry issue for N-even is also unimportant.  It only matters for the academic exercise of trying to create a function centered at n=0 whose DTFT is real-valued.  But most actual windowing is done like Window_function#Window_examples,with an even number of points and a window centered at (N-1)/2; i.e. the visible peak is flat-topped at both w(N/2-1) and w(N/2+1).

 You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. Note that the three-revert rule prohibits making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. If necessary, pursue dispute resolution.   Remember that as per WP:CCC no consensus is permanent.  I have proposed a change as per WP:BOLD, and see no protest from any users other than yourself.  If you would like to discuss a potential compromise to reach a new consensus I would be more than open to that, but simply dismissing my change without any form of discourse goes against the nature of WP.

Then, after struggling, Duffy came to the rescue, who asked his wife to send a box of pictures to Cantrell. All the pictures Duffy's real-life family were taken, decades ago (before Duffy's parents were murdered, in real-life), as well as a baby picture of Patrick, himself. His real-life mother also bore a slight resemblance to Bel Geddes, whose character made a photo of her holding baby Patrick, exactly what Cantrell needed. His real-life late parents made a cameo on the revised Dallas series.""""

You are warned.
You have, you and different mormons users, vandalise the talk page as a group in order to eliminate contributions of non mormons who disturbed you and I found this unacceptable and against all wikis essentials rules.
I will therefor not bow under you threats and insist for the intervention of a non mormon administrator who isnt a personal friend as well.
There is clear discriminatorics actions who have to stop and being alone against 10, it is difficult but not all impossible.
I simply cant accept that a group of religious extremists insist on imposing their views on different talkpage at the cost of wikipedias rule of equality and neutrality and at the cost of real information as well.
 I am not hiding as you are all doing so at the moment nor lying and pretending something else.
I do reply to those attacks, but I have the dignity to leave place for the other users, and to dont revert their texts and to in fact reinsert their answers and questions with mine who were deleeted with theirs.
The excuse of archiving is very thin seen in the light of the real purpose, and rearrching in less than 24 hours, after only 4 posts, is unacceptable and to spit at wikipedias face.
Do you think that all wikipedians are idiots and cannot see what you are trying to do?
I was called a troll, a lyer many times, insulted, and anyway terminated my contributions and answers to this with: """"kind regards"""", that was until the joke went too far, and the insults too loud, and the circus was too obvious that I used a more direct language, but it was not before you started those mass reverting actions disguise as archiving that I really went angry and asked for proper explainations.
Which you answer to by reverting even more.
I dont accept this.
You have no rights to do so and your insistency at grabing at wikis morality and set of rules to cover up for your diffamations is both hysterical and an hypocrisie who do not fool anybody.
i can see that you have all a long time training at doing so as you exchan´ge each time who is going to bear the hat...this way each person remain innocent as the guilt is dispearsed among as many as possible.
Very smart, but not less dishonnest nor more invisible.
Try pronoïa instead of being all trying to found something wrong about me and come back to my first text to wich you never answered and most certainly never read to understand it. You read it to critisized it.
Here is the result of your crusade.
Are you happy with it?

How can we presuppose that Michel Aoun enjoys the support of more than 70% of the population when the last election results of 2005 prove that statistic wrong and no comprehensive polling of the Christian population has ever been conducted? This is speculative at best (and perhaps too optimistic, again, according to 2005 election results). Also, Michel Aoun's knowledge of Italian and Spanish is paltry at best, so that should be put into question as well. In addition, no mention of Aoun's """"poor parents"""" has ever been made, unless you assume that having a butcher for a father is an unquestionable characteristic of poverty and low-class. Also, as reference to his tenure as prime minister from 1988 to 1990, I propose adding an """"acting"""" in parentheses after the prime minister title, as the Lebanese Constitution briefs that only a Sunni Muslim may hold that position (or we should precise that his tenure was an exception or an anomaly, once again for the reason listed earlier).""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet you ignore the fact that:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+)and you contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from a buyer's desired litter to another compatible (again, based on your own determination) litter AFTER the buyer has submitted payment to you. (see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""")

You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time of purchase, but you also require them to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights, in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement or even a suggestion by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), your own literature (except some very limited information by Dr. Padgett and numerous and righteous religious and biblical quotations).

You are the """"Chairman"""" of the board of directors for your registry's dog club, the SSDCA (which charges for membership and participation in club activities).  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override any challenges to your decisions.

You control the ISSR dog registry, which charges puppy owners/breeders numerous fees for numerous types of registration papers and other background information, not to mention also deciding if/when/where/how any breeders in your registry are allowed to breed their dogs.  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Some notes 

Hi Amoruso, in regards to your edits on Palestinian refugee and Palestinian exodus, I want to ask you for a favor. While I don't agree that Katz is as neutral a source as you claim, I'm usually not one to advocate censorship on Wikipedia. However, you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point (i.e. showing your sourced POV that you want to convey) without endless quotes from one rather biased source. The problem I have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of anti-Palestinian quotes that, intentionally or not, turn the article into a hate blog. Again, while I admit I don't agree with your analysis as I think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization, I am NOT asking you to remove it. What I am asking is that you make your point concisely, neutrally, (i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way, if that makes sense), and in an encyclopedic manner. Endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material. There are much better, proper, and neutral ways to make your point. Thanks  (talk) 

p.s. I noticed a new article Western Wall Tunnel in which you used a Haaretz article by Akiva Eldar as proof that Arafat 'incited' riots. That article says nothing of the sort, and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as 'evidence' that Arafat was trying to get out of a dead end. It would be helpful to make that small section both accurate and NPOV. Thanks.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rhobite, I think the word """"great"""" may be confusing you.  Sure, what's great for me isn't necessarilly great for you; but when something is great for the many, the qualification becomes objective.  Hellmuth is regularly the chosen televised table, and was invited to this year's tournament of champions event (despite not qualifying) solely for his television appeal.  He currently has logged more minutes on ESPN than any other player.  I'm sorry if you don't know this subject well enough to understand it, but Hellmuth is univerally known and agreed to produce great television.  If I watched Michael Jordan play basketball and thought he was bad, it would not change the fact that he could be objectively described as a """"great"""" basketball player.

For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly.

Here's a hint. If your textbooks in grade schools didn't claim Israel doesn't have a right to exist, if parents in your society weren't teaching their kids that blowing up my people is a wonderful thing that will get them 72 virgins, if your government didn't name streets after mass murderers, pay blood money to the parents of mass murderers, put them on camera hailing their kids as heroes, and if YOUR PEOPLE weren't spending their time and money on buying weapons and digging smuggling tunnels instead of fixing infrastructure, starting businesses, and building better lives, then there would be no need for checkpoints, no need for a big-ass wall, no need for anything of the sort. And you'd have your state. You'd have had it decades ago if your goal was to have a state.

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

 Removal of references to Scruton's response—and defence—to the episode in The Guardian;
 Removal of a positive review (of Dooley's comment that Sexual Desire is """"magisterial"""") despite this having being discussed on this talk page;
 The extent of the coverage given to his views on homosexuality.

That's not what I heard. I read somewhere that the verses were about Beyonce but from years earlier. at the time of Kingdom Come, Beyonce was 25, but the verses refer to the girl being 23. This shows that the verse was written after the black album, and could have been used for Kingdom come. They are clearly back together in Kindom Come, and the song could have been from a rough patch in '04-'05. Both theories are possible and should be included in the article

Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content.

JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in the Information Management Research Institute at Northumbria University (UK). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students.
JPlag
https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
Guido Malpohl initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. JPlag also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use JPlag for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students.
Library Electronic Databases

The Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like EBSCO and Expanded Academic ASAP (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students.
Moss
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html
Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, C++, Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only.
Plagiarism.org
http://www.plagiarism.org 
University of California Berkeley students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing.

Stop calling people """"nationalists"""". It is offensive and a waste of time. According to the modern psychiatry and the police detectives interrogation techniques, you are the ones that are nationalistic and one sided because of self-projection psychological projection.

Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to """"kiboze""""). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. 

James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.

Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.

Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.

Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.
So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Race and intelligence (explanations)#Spearman's hypothesis

IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties. Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents. The mean Black-White difference varies considerably across tests with different contents. For example, the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order. Across a large number of test, the standardized mean Black-White gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation. According to , """"this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean W-B difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests.""""

""""The g-based factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities"""" Correlations between an IQ subtest's g-loading, and the magnitude of the Black-White-East Asian score gap for that subtest (;  pp. 47-8;  pp. 138-9).  For example, the Black-White gap is greater on backward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test) than forward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given, and the less g-loaded test).  As predicted by Spearman's hypothesis, the B-W gap is largest on the most g-loaded tests.  Narrowing of the B-W gap has been seen mostly on less g-loaded tests, such as literacy tests. Murray, C.  (2005) """"The Inequality Taboo"""".  Commentary Magazine, September 2005. Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the Black-White gap (for example, """"past history of slavery"""", discrimination, """"caste status"""", """"peer pressure against 'acting white'"""", etc) have an effect on g (, p. 510).
|The author of multiple factor analysis, L. L. Thurstone (1947), warned """"we must guard against the simple, but common, error of merely taking a first centroid factor, a first principal component, or other mean factor, in a test battery and then calling it a general factor"""".  """"Spearman's g, then, is a """"statistical artifact."""" (C. Loring Brace, 2001)

""""a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test""""

2e0ad1f45fed6ee6,"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   
 I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is """"the scientific study of human populations"""". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   

Non-families

I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories: """"had children under the age of 18 living with them"""", """"were married couples living together"""", """"had a female householder with no husband present"""", and  """"non-families"""". These categories do not add up to 100%;, for examples see Downers Grove, Willowick, Ohio, etc etc. Any ideas about where this came from, and how it can be addressed? It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. Novickas

I'm not necessarily advocating a change, but """"confectionary"""" doesn't seem anymore neutral to me than """"candy"""".  From the American perspective, """"sweet"""" is used much, much more than """"confectionary"""".  Also, perhaps this is biased, but if there's a dispute as to which country's term ought to be used, shouldn't the fact that over 2/3 of native English speakers reside in the United States be factored into the discussion.  In other words, isn't the prevalent usage of a word in America essentially the more prevalent usage of the word in general?  
Absolutely not. Following your logic, then this would be usa.wikipedia.org. However, since it's en.wikipedia.org, it caters for all English speakers all over the world. The guidelines specifically say that no one national variety of English should be favoured over any other, in general - and where possible, internationally-neutral compromises should be used. The term """"confectionery"""" is internationally neutral, as belongs in an international encyclopædia. If you want to start a usa-only version then be my guest: in the meantime, we all use the international one.  talk 

I really don't understand this discussion, I myself am not a native English speaker, but have had a thorough English education. There is different word use on wording and spelling in English as in other languages, language is never static and not invented by an organisation but spoken by people. Even dictionaries don't include all words immediatly on use. Is the word google a verb? Is it in a dictionary? Will it be in the future? I really see no need for this discussion, if there are many POV's (read wordings) the best way to be NPOV is to include all POV's with a note on where they came from and where they are used.  

I'm removing the 'list of candies' because it doesn't give you any information you wouldn't get by just clicking on the """"Category:Confectionery"""" link.  Further, these category pages keep themselves up to date.  The list in this article only lists a fraction of the 'candy articles'.

 Removal of branded names from candy types 
Should we remove such things as Reese bits from candy types? It's too specific, and, what's worse, brand specific.

 Candyarian? 
What's the adjective for someone who eats only candy?  

 Various options that spring to mind (depending on how long they've been doing this for) include """"fat"""" and """"dead"""". If you do have a reason to use the term, I'm sure there's no law against coining """"candyarian"""" to serve. (There is some paranoia against using words that aren't in the dictionary, but I doubt most dictionaries include the word """"eats"""". The important thing is if you're understood, and if it suits the context.) 

 Of course, """"candarian"""" is a bit dangerous because it's based on a dialect-specific term; you might find Australians then discussing """"lolliarians"""". Perhaps it could be based on """"confectionery"""" which is dialect-neutral albeit formal, thus giving """"confectionerian"""" (I imagine a """"confectionarian"""" is someone who eats places that sell confeck, rather than the confeck itself—probably no better for your long-term health!).

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 9000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger
I reverted your edit because you just destroyed the continuity of that section. 

As for your claims, I don't see any standards/templates set for what a player's season recap should include. I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information, and certaintly not enough for individual players. I think those articles are poorly done, and I'm not interested in improving them. I do not like the prose-style recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of """"In week X of the XXXX season, Player X did this and that against Team X in a XX-XX win/loss..."""" For the longest time that's how Drew Brees' 2009 season (a great individual season that deserves better writing) read. It still has some of those problems. 

The way I've done it gives it structure. You don't have to repeat who the opponent was, what week it was or the result. And these are NFL players. They'll play 16 games a year, 20 at the most with the playoffs. I'm not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games. It's a small sample. Write a sentence or two for each game and you're talking 16-40 sentences at the most. Hardly creates a long section.

I really suggest you look at Denard Robinson (Michigan QB) and his current season recap. He has sub-sections with lots of text for each individual game this year. And you know what, I don't see anyone changing it or complaining about it. It doesn't bother me. While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players (so don't get worried), I have to say their info is written pretty well and it's sourced and everything. That much info on one game is pretty crazy, but you know what, where are the restrictions on space?

Come on man, this is the internet. We're not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia. The space is there. I'll make sure to refrain from any further mention of team-oriented things like """"going on a bye week"""", but other than that, the text has been about Ben, so it's on topic and referenced. I don't see the big deal, and I can't say I'm seeing other people questioning it besides yourself. I didn't even start Manning's 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having, but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today. Looks fine to me. And since there's been free reign given on these kind of sections, again, I don't see the problem.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is rational to be hostile to immigrant populations, this is well supported by evolutionary psychology evidence; to describe this hostility as phobia, one is implicitly making a moral judgement on a behaviour that is widely agreed in science to be instinctive; and thus such a subjective moral connotation is irrational and unjustified.

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

509e40e2a072cdb1,"Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It's hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.

As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass.

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

Note: Many articles about the rabbis of the Talmud and Mishnah are derived from the archaic Jewish Encyclopedia, published between 1901-1906, over one hundred years ago (when the Middle East was still under the thumb of the Ottoman Turks) and which used the archaic expressions """"Palestine"""" when referring to the Land of Israel, and to the Jews living in the areas of the historical Land of Israel as """"Palestinians."""" This is a big mistake that requires constant attention and correction, especially when copying and editing articles from the Jewish Encyclopedia or from similarly archaic sources such as Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897). At this time, no-one uses the term/s """"Palestinian/s"""" (in relation to anything associated with Jews or the land they lived in and which they regarded as their homeland) nor by any type of conventional Jewish scholarship, particularly at the present time when the label """"Palestinian"""" is almost entirely identified with the Palestinian Arabs who are mostly Muslims.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

In the former eastern territories of the Second Polish Republic, attached to the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Republics after Soviet invasion of Poland, the organization and the operations of the Soviet partisans were similar to that in the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories.

Furthermore, it's bad faith to try to use such things to disregard edits made in good faith. You are just trying to bully your way into getting what you want, but you already lost consensus, so you're not going to get it anyway.

And speaking of bad faith, you claimed you did not oppose redirecting to photo editing yet you blind reverted the change for no reason and left it that way even after the merge was complete AND you insisted upon trying to do more of a merge. Therefore your only so-called justification for the revert no longer holds true. If you want to demonstrate good faith instead of proving bad faith you should have undid your revert so that the article was redirected, per the consensus. IF we dispute where it goes that can always changed later, but at this point all you are doing is ignoring consensus and doing what you wanted to do in the first place with a shoddy excuse.  05:24, 15",0,0,0,0,0,0

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

Does a reference to a non-canonical book exist just because there is similar language?  Some of Paul's so-called references seem to be little more than his borrowing of a turn of phrase.  In at least one case, a supposedly non-canonical source seems canonical to me.  Chronicles refers to a """"book of Samuel, the seer"""" describing the deeds of King David.  Last I checked, there was a book in the bible accredited to Samuel, who was a seer, and that book was largely about the deeds of King David.

 Cybercopyedit, Optics, Alhazen, etc. 

Hi. About Cybercopyedit's changes to Optics: This isn't sockpuppetry. I complained that his previous username did not comply with policy and he handled it by creating a new one, which is one of the recommended ways to deal with that problem. 

I think he may have a valid point about Alhazen's book. The article's previous statement that the book merely """"documented the then-current understanding of vision"""" does not appear to be supported by the reference that was already cited in the article. I took a quick skim through the parts of it that are freely accessible earlier today, and it appeared to show that Alhazen's work significantly expanded on the previous understanding of the subject. Based on that one reference (not contributed by Cybercopyedit as far as I know), it appears that a stronger statement of Alhazen's contribution is warranted. I'll take a closer look when I have a chance.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quran qoute should be deleted
In the section Position on use of armed strength to achieve aims
This Quran qoute should be deleted:

The Qur'an states, """"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not do aggression, for Allah loves not the aggressors. Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers."""" (Al-Baqarah 190-193)[85]

The qoute is from a non Hezbollah-affiliated website and thus it is irrelevant to Hezbollah's stance on the use of armed strength. Hezbollah may also use this surah to legitimize the use of armed strength, but one would have to cite directly to a Hezbollah source to prove so. You can probably find some usuable qoutes in Naem Qassem's book Hizbullah: The story from within published in 2006 or from Hezbollah website.

Hi Pigsonthewing,

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part. It seems that you've lost the joy in editing Wikipedia, and now you do as some sort of way of making yourself feel better at the expense of others. What a small, small man you are. Grow up! Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down. I'm here to create an encyclopedia. You seem to be here to fight with other people and cause disruptions. You're making everyone else's life harder. Please stop that; just go away.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1,0,0,0,0,0

So, the British sided with the Americans, and the current border reflects the American claim?
What were the differences between this and the Canadian claim? - Unsigned User:Geo Swan

Actually, the current boundary does not reflect the maximal U.S. claim.  I'll try to trype in some more info.   

The British didn't exactly side with the Americans; the border settlement was an arbitration (the Kaiser again, IIRC, as it had been with his father at the end of the San Juans Dispute).  The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.  The main difference between the British hard position and the way things are now is that under the British terms, thet """"Yukon Ports"""" - Skagway and Haines and Dyea etc would have been """"British"""", i.e. part of British Columbia.

Canada didn't have a say in it, other than consulting London; British North American (Canadian) foreign affairs were still in London's bailiwick at that time (until 1931 or 1927 or something).

As it is under the treaty, the site of Forts Stikine and Taku should be within British Columbia; and in fact the mouths of the Stikine and Taku should be, but they've silted in a few miles downstream since the treaty was signed; the border hasn't been revised to reflect that (obviously not, even though it's in the language; same thing with the mis-survey of the 49th Parallel that's not going to get corrected, either).

There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on """"their"""" side of that line.

Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the """"international waterway"""" (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a """"foreign port"""" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. 

Further Thoughts

Just considering the opening statements; the treaty was actually between the British Empire, with the Dominion of Canada as a signatory party, IIRC; BC was not involved in the actual signing.

And just as aside the phrasing of the second condition of the treaty cited:

Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.

...is completely bizarre for anybody who's ever actually looked at a map of the coastline.  The negotiators were in London and Washington and Ottawa, far away with only the dimmest idea of where they were talking about.  Much the same as the Oregon Treaty, only worse; there """"the deepest channel"""" seemed at least a bit logical, even though they didn't note the issues on the map with Point Roberts and the Gulf Islands/San Juans which make that border a bit of an absurdity; which so is the 49th Parallel from the Rockies west....that aside, the Alaska treaty issue cited is utterly bizarre; the Alaskan coast is a ragged array of inlets and bays, pierced by several large rivers.  There is no """"crest of the mountains"""", for one thing - other than crowsflight-drawn lines from high peak to high peak, which i",0,0,0,0,0,0

Moreover, there seems to be no logical distinction between the calibre of Los Angeles based community hunts (which openly tout for money) and the web based community hunt on the web to which goldenkeyquest.com refers (which, again, is free).

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

There's a disagreement that has reached the DYK talk page at WT:DYK#Hook pull off about a hook that was pulled because a hook was deemed insufficiently interesting, but then examples of close paraphrasing were given, but there's a disagreement with the nominator as to whether it really is close paraphrasing.

The """"make it pay"""" business is a distinct phrase used by Barber and plagiarised by you. Try and rise above your embittered feelings and see that. As for the rest: you - as you admit - are not seeing good faith; are accusing me of bias without providing any evidence whatsoever, and you make claims demonstrably false that you've apologised three times. It's open to you to substantiate any of your claims, but you have entirely failed to do so. However you look at it, making scurrilous allegations without a shred of evidence and thinking that you've apoligsed when you've merely repeated the allegations is the action of a sociopath. However you have my assurance that this is distinct from your casual and uncaring plagiarism.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

84be687da8b2d870,""":Voltaire as an egalitarian is about the funniest thing I've heard in a long time; of course he was not (and harldy any of the Enlightenment philosophes were). Does that diminish his statue as a thinker? Of course not; non-conformity with 21st-century sensibilities hardly matters in any assessment of an 18th-century thinker. As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all. However, given the above discussion, I sort of doubt whether wikipedia readers/editors understand enough history to appreciate this. In any case I give it a go, by deleting the presently pointless section on Voltaire's views on race ....

From what I can tell, the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of LDS-related articles, and those edits were reverted by various editors, myself included.  Now, there are two main ways of viewing these facts: one, that your edits were consistent with Wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so; two, that your edits were not consistent with Wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them.

You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.

I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a """"new Uncle Joe"""" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.

Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war """"new economic policy"""" of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.

The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume """"The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945"""". You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a """"hard earned victory in WWII"""".

So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.

In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.

 Completion date 

Once again, someone has changed the completion date to 30 June '09, though this time they have modified the reference so it no longer shows the photo with the billboard saying 30 Dec '08.  The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

I think we should change the completion to 2009, but not include an exact date.  Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

Wow, interesting information.  First, let me say that I don't doubt the truth of what you're saying.  However, because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source, it qualifies as original research, which is not permitted on Wikipedia.  Typically, this type of information would have to be removed from an article.

I feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source, however, another editor could come along and justifiably remove it.

You also say that Jannettia Brodsgaaard Propps amassed a collection of memorabilia which she did not. She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.

There are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the """"conflict"""" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their """"version"""" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.

I now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed """"Smith"""" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. 

And again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a """"mention."""" He had no direct involvment in the """"making"""" of the film.

I would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone """"mentions"""" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.

We would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner. Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation. In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands. Shame on you.

They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad.

I have apologized to Dr. Dec at the RD/M as I have now realized that it was wrong to accuse him without sufficient evidence. It also would have created unnecessary WikiDrama, and been counterproductive should I have proceeded.

However, I did honestly believe that the OP intended to waste our times - the reason I did not proceed to the talk page was because I thought it was too small a matter and only deserved a small remark. In the future, I shall take your advice to heart; if I do respond to an OP at the reference desk for a similar reason, I shall ensure that it is only done if absolutely necessary.

Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead.

 The Indigenous Peoples of North America PortalThe Indigenous Peoples of North America Portal has been established, as a starting point for those wishing to learn more about the subject, with information and links on a wide variety of issues. It also contains news regarding the continent's various tribes and nations. It's a graphically pleasing site, and everyone is encouraged to check it out. Home Page Reorganization The project's home page has a new design, featuring tabbed subpages on participants, templates, articles, categories, and the to do list. Article Classification MoveThe Article Classification lists have been moved to their own subpage due to size. This is a sign of progress in the ongoing work of this project. New Talk Page Template The project's talk page template has been updated, along with the classification system, to include the assessment on the talk pages of the articles that have been classified and assessed.

As the Project reaches its first six months of activity, the great effort all of you have invested in it has turned the vast information available on Indigenous North American topics from a deorganized cumulous into an excellent and easy to consult database. Although much work is still in order, few WikiProjects are able to obtain the amazing results we are proud to show today. To all of you, thank you and congratulations!
|-
! What You Can Do to Help
|-
|style=""""color:#000""""|The assessment of articles within the scope of the project is still an ongoing process. We need people to help in this who are not contributors to the articles they are assessing. Also, there is the ongoing need for identifying and cataloguing articles that fall within the scope of this project. As of today, nearly 1,500 have been identified within the Project's scope.

Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture.

Go ahead and call the cops.  They'll laugh at you as I did.  I'd love to hear the conversation if you call the cops.  They'll treat you as if you're insane.  They won't investigate anything like what you're talking about.  You apparently don't know much about how courts and police work.  They like physical suspects to question and arrest.  1) The police will not investigate even serious death threats from out of state.  It's not their responsibility. 2) I don't know of any police organization that would take the time to investigate a death threat from an anonymous IP on the internet.  3) When the police are called about death threats, they'll often tell you to wait until the person making the death threat shows up and then call them again.  You apparently need psychiatric help.  I know a seriously unbalanced personality when I see one.  By restoring that information about the nipple slip, you have ruined a perfectly good encyclopedic article and turned it into a trashy supermarket tabloid.  Congratulations.  You're one of the worst editors here, and you're probably headed for a permanent block.  Don't post comments on my talk page again.  If you do, they will be deleted.  You have no positive things to say, no positive contributions to make.  You need to clean up your act, or leave Wikipedia.  Nobody needs or wants editors like you.  By the way, archive your talk.  It's too long.  Also, read WP:LEGAL.  You've violated it, and can be permanently banned for it.

But when I see his messy edits I leave them alone to avoid conflict. But you Drmies, you treat people like shit. Like you """"I want to delete this article period by period"""" comment in the talk page of an academic and holocaust survivor. You don't get to act to like an anti-semite and bully people you disagree with and then cry foul when editors point out that you are abusive. Your actions speak for themselves. You first actions as an admin were to impost your POV on a contentious article. And you statement that you don't want to block me is a blatant lie. you have said just the opposite in the past and participated in accusations of socking to try and get me blocked indefinitely. This is on top of our long running conflict. So you lie as much as you want and you can block me if I point out the facts that demonstrate you're a liar, but bigotry, bullying, bias, prejudice, discrimination and other abuses are wrong.

Your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per Wikipedia guidelines until Jayjg and SlimVirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article, and reverting it to what we have now, as punitive gestures.  If we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better, instead of punishing each other, there is no reason the article has to be locked.
I agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on.

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi Marcuse. I see you've run into Sojambi Pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. He is friend of Biff Rose's. They mention each other on their respective web spots. Looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. Too bad someone else wrote about Rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. The sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his NPOV- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) Notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place. Also of note is his complete inability to sleuth.

 A beating 

Hello Shovon, I see you've taken quite a beating dealing with some trolls regarding the Kashmir issue. As a piece of advice, just don't entertain (feed) trolls because this only increases our pressure. Who cares, let them call us """"Hindu facist"""" or """"faggot"""" or whatever because that only reflects on the person making those remarks, and needless to say, their country. Such actions speak a thousand words and it's foolhardy for us to waste our time and energy feeding such trolls. I avoided naming this section """"Kashmir"""" fearing you wouldn't give a damn! Have a cookie in the mean time. Take care.  ☎ """,0,0,1,0,0,1

Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.

 Symptoms 
 Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others
 Assumes bad faith frequently
 TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA)
 Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia""""
 Impatience
 Exhibits immediatism
 Hangs out in project namespace
 Has no time for featured articles
 Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted
 Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...)
 Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life
 Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll
 Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons
 Seems to enjoy biting new users
 General BOFHness
 Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely,
 Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense
 Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me""""
 Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny""""
 Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before
 Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person
 Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior
 Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar
 Exhibits signs of MPOV
 Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice
 Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack
 Indulges in biting delicious newcomers

 Diagnosis 
It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness: 

 You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!).
 """"Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought.
 """"Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki. 
 If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis.
 Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis.
 If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected. 
 And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.

 Pathophysiology 
The infectious nature of this illness is unknown at this time.  More study needs to be conducted in order to identify transmission mechanisms. No effective containment mechanisms have been identified. So far anti-vandal bots have proved immune to this condition, although as yet there is no convincing explanation concerning this anomaly. 

Observational studies have noted that sufferers will seek the counsel of their Wikipedia friends, but end up infecting them in the process. Other studies have noted the evolution of a Wikipedia editor as potentially having a causal role in this illness.

 One MO' time for the kids in the back... 

JUST can’t let go of a few items, huh?

Okay from the top:
1) My info on the GLAAD awards and the EISNER Nominations came from Winick’s website. BUT is that’s not good enough…

2)  I did a quick GOOGLE ( WINICK and GLAAD AWARDS) and found various articles to that effect. Here’s one that mention awards from 2001 & 2002

http://www.psicofxp.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-105929.html

here’s the link to the GLAAD awards in 2003 ( they don’t archive back further then that)

http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3393&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43
 
and a photo from 2003

http://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3396&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43

3) the Eisners was more difficult because were too many sites and not a definitive archive. I punched in """"Winick and Eisner awards"""" into GOOGLE and got over 500 hits. Some mention his nominations in articles ABOUT him, some site specific years in articles ABOUT the Eisner nominations. It doesn’t look like his website is lying…

Now, onto some specific comments:

""""Furthermore, I saw the article more pro-gay than anti-gay. I think the previous version of the article attempts to put Judd in a rather """"heroic"""" role by saying that he pushed boundaries and was willing to shrug off industry standards to get his point across. It may have had a POV issue, but I don't think that it was homophobic. I would be careful about throwing that word around, being that you are suggesting unbiased claims. Practice what you preach, and all that.""""

Forgive me jumping the gun on mentioning """"homophobia"""", but the article REALLY didn’t read as positive or heroic when: 
1) It focussed  –almost ENTIRELY—on the issue of Winick writing about gays.
 
2)Tossed some interpretation that he made Robin( of Batman and Robin) into a crossdresser ( which he didn’t. it was JOKE. It’d be like accusing MONTY PYTHON of promoting """" lifestyle choices"""" by having them dress as women all the time)

3)Adding/allowing an erroneous comment from another comic book creator. (MIKE Miller, later changed into the a false statement by FRANK Miller)

4) And lastly, make mention of """" gay groups"""" who took issue with, disagreed with, etc, Mr. Winick’s portrayal of gays. No evidence t that fact was given and it appears that the VAST majority of the gay community doesn’t have a problem with him.

All of THIS, didn’t really come off as an endorsement, a slap on the back, or in much of ANY way that he was being applauded for making a stand.

""""I would add two points: (1) The article should definitely include some discussion, albeit NPOV, of Winick's penchant for gay characters. He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either. The article should be neutral, but that fact is a critical facet of Winick's career. """"

I don’t agree. It COVERS the issue already. You’re asking for an opinion. I’ve been told, several times, that THAT isn’t the point of this site.

Also, """"Winick's penchant for gay characters"""". Why JUST talk about gays? I mean, is it because  he get PRESS about them?  He’s got LOTS of other people in his comics. But if you’re mentioning GAYS because it’s gotten media coverage, then THAT is already IN the article. No need to expand on it.

""""He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn't made a secret of that, either.""""

1) What’s all this stuff about YOUNG readers? Comics, and even his book were aimed at ALL readers? Are you trying to slide in a sideways comment that Winick is targeting children? And secondly, in the 3 times I’ve heard Winick talk about this subject he always comes back to the point that he includes ALL types of people in his stories. Diversity is the goal.

In general you seem VERY intent on shining a different light on this issue. One that falls into opinion and editorializing.
 The facts are covered. It’s there. It’s done.

(2) He is not considered """"one of the top writers"""" in comics. Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Jeph Loeb...there are plenty of names at the top, but Winick's has never been among them. I've never read a claim otherwise, either  so if this article is going to allege Winick's prominence, you'd better include some sort of citation. 

Well, 1) It doesn’t say he’s the MOST prominent writer in comics like a Frank  Miller, Neil Gaiman,  Grant Morrison or an Alan Moore. It’s says ONE of the top writers.
To that fact, He’s one of only about 30 writers signed exclusively, he writes top titl",0,0,0,0,0,0

Re this edit, which I mostly reverted. I've run into similar problems elsewhere, where a few works are cited many times, and it's useful to collect the the full citations into a section, and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 WikiCup 2014 February newsletter 

And so ends the most competitive first round we have ever seen, with 38 points required to qualify for round 2. Last year, 19 points secured a place; before that, 11 (2012) or 8 (2011) were enough. This is both a blessing and a curse. While it shows the vigourous good health of the competition, it also means that we have already lost many worthy competitors. Our top three scorers were:

, a WikiCup newcomer whose high-quality scans of rare banknotes represent an unusual, interesting and valuable contribution to Wikipedia. Most of Godot's points this round have come from a large set of pictures used in Treasury Note (1890–91).
, a WikiCup veteran and a finalist last year, Adam is also a featured picture specialist, focusing on the restoration of historical images. This month's promotions have included a carefully restored set of artist William Russell Flint's work.
, another WikiCup newcomer. WikiRedactor has claimed points for good article reviews and good articles relating to pop music, many of which were awarded bonus points. Articles include Sky Ferreira, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus and """"Wrecking Ball"""" (Miley Cyrus song).

Other competitors of note include:

, who helped take Thirty Flights of Loving through good article candidates and featured article candidates, claiming the first first featured article of the competition.
, who claimed the first featured list of the competition with Natalia Kills discography.
, who takes the title of the contributor awarded the highest bonus point multiplier (resulting in the highest scoring article) of the competition so far. Her high-importance salamander, now a good article, scored 108 points.

After such a competitive first round, expect the second round to also be fiercely fought. Remember that any content promoted after the end of round 1 but before the start of round 2 can be claimed in round 2, but please do not update your submission page until March (UTC). Invitations for collaborative writing efforts or any other discussion of potentially interesting work is always welcome on the WikiCup talk page. Remember, if two or more WikiCup competitors have done significant work on an article, all can claim points equally.

If you are concerned that your nomination—whether it is at good article candidates, a featured process, or anywhere else—will not receive the necessary reviews, please list it on Wikipedia:WikiCup/Reviews. If you want to help out with the WikiCup, please do your bit to help keep down the review backlogs!

Please help me understand.  You were not involved in teh talk discussions, and edits I completed after learning Kuru stated my entry was promotional.  So what refernce and evidence did you use to block my edit access and state my comments were unwarranted harrassment?  I do not want to appear argumentative and certainly want to comply with the rules of Wiki.  You also refered to my act as vandalism which I think is harsh and unwarratnted.  If you check with Mr. Kuru I think he will tell you were were having a legitamit discussion and my edits, subsequent with his deletion were inetnded to comply with his request to remove promotional material.  I simply subsequently loaded a link to the approved patent on the USPTO patent site.  It provides substantial reference, teh approved business method patent, prior art, abstracta nd claims.  I think your actions were premature and showed you lacked informationa bout what was being discussed between Kuru and I.  I would still like to refernce the patent and since it had previously been done and sanctioned acceptable because it was on teh site undisturbed for 2 months I think this has merit.  I do see the fact that my name, as teh inventor tends to promote thepatent.  However, if you check I am not the owner.  It is owned by Ultimate Claim Solution, Inc.  My refernce also tried to explain that aspect.  Non the less this all could have been avoided.  When someones content is deleted the person making thatd elrtion should point out in there csignature they are an administrtor or moderator.  Had Kuro done that I would have talked to him first instead of trying to update the edit to what I thought ws not promotional and then trying to engage in talk with Mr. Kuru.  

Lastly, I respectfully request you release the block.  I aslo request that I be given permission to return the article to the annonomus post which refernced the patent.  Those observing will not note that I am ihe inventor.  It is not promotion, simply good refernce and citation.

great job with those idoits that keep taking wabalios awards
GREETINGS I am the great pickelbarrel and I wanted to say thank you for helping to sove the problem my very good friend Wabalio was having with these stupid vandals that kept taking his awards.  When I first met him he was ALL JUICED UP ON THE MARY JANE and it was impossible to make heads or tails of what he was talking about.  He seems to have ridden his system of this dangerous narcotic.  The only problem I have is that it seems that I ALSO cant edit his page.  Apparently, in order to get rid of those that kept taking the awards I gave him, you mistakingly made it impossible for ANY editor to write to him.  That is good, and bad.  While it will certainly keep away the mariujuana dealers that he had been associating with, it also prevents me from giving him little things to show him how proud we are of his """"drug free"""" life style.  All the studies show that these gifts can really make a HUGE difference in a """"dopeaholics"""" life.  I hope there is some way we can remedy this unfortunate error.

Again from the Duel books pushing what was a politically driven firing trial in order to prove the quality of the armored plate.

Evidence provided by Carey Erickson concludes that the tests were politically motivated to artificially bolster the performance of the US 76mm gun over the 17 pounder gun which was unfairly  marginalized during the tests the Panthers themselves according to the researcher had significant battle damage (burned out, multiple hits, to front plate ,etc.) or were hit many times to lower the plate resistance before the tests were recorded. 

small excerpt:
  Panther Ausf. A tank labeled as No. 1 listed as having a good quality plate was in reality was face hardened (a curious rarity at this point of the war) and took 9 rounds to weaken the plate enough to allow penetration. Evidence also shows that the Panther tank No. 3 had serious battle damage before being subjected to the firing tests which should have excluded it from being tested in the first place.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

This is an interesting question for the Wikipedia community: Does posting a link on a member’s Talk page to a YouTube video of yourself firing a weapon constitute threatening behavior?Background: In the article about San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, I have been debating BillyTFried about whether the article should include information about Daly’s support of a 2006 gun control ballot initiative, Proposition H. I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted some words on my Talk page along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)

Last night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified. She pointed out that BillyTFried lives in the same town as me (he told me the cross streets where he lives) and that his post on my Talk page with the video link was made in the context of a gun control debate. She thought he was threatening me.

I did not take up this matter with BillyTFried because, frankly, after watching his video, I don't want anything to do with him. I’m just curious what the community thinks of this and whether some action should be taken against BillyTFried.

 I agree with LLM. Looking at it from the other direction, I think that a title (a) categorizes and (b) describes the content, and that it also establishes the basic (c) inclusion criteria. When content and title are not in agreement, one or the other must change so as to establish harmony between the two. A title must also (d) be NPOV. A loose title establishes broad inclusion criteria, while a very specific title establishes narrow inclusion criteria.

 Choosing an easement curve 

I'd like to be clear about:
(a) which curves are actually used in practice ...
(b) in the various railways administrations; not just North American but also others, e.g. Australian, European, Indian etc.  (This would help with NPOV.)

My main concern is with (a).  Although the article mostly discusses Euler spirals, it seems to give the impression that's the only curve used, under varying names.  However, consider this quotation (from the AREMA reference in the article):
There are several different types of mathematical spirals available for use, including the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate.  Of more common use on railways are the Searles, the Talbot and the AREMA 10-Chord spirals, which are empirical approximations of true spirals.
This reference is, of course, discussing common use on American railways; but even in this limited context, it appears there are at least three ideal mathematical spiral forms involved: """"the clothoid, the cubic parabola and the lemniscate"""", along with various practical approximations to them.

The article would ideally give the history of the use and adaptation of these various spiral forms.  Doing so would provide a solid illustration of how technological innovation was both necessitated and encouraged by the Age of Rail - a valuable insight into the social impact of rail.

I'm guessing that the AREMA reference probably continues on from the quote above to give some further detail about those approximations, their inventors and their history; but it may not.  In any case, can anybody provide suitable references to help flesh out this story?

M, This colon convention gets out of hand after maybe two. 
I've just looked over the articles you suggested I might take an eye to. We will have something to discuss, I see. You don't take on small issues! Much more daring than I am. 
I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. 

I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. 
Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. 

This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Freyr statuette
Hi Bloodofox, I made another trip to the museum to take more pictures. I have both good and bad news. The famous hammer you talked about is in the main display together with the statuette of Freyr and a statuette of Odin and several other pagan objects. The good news is that they can be seen and that they are apparently considered to be national treasures, being in the main display in the high security """"gold room"""". The bad news is that as I was taking pictures of them, a guard told me that it is forbidden to take pictures in that section of the museum, and when I got home the pictures were of too bad quality anyway.

 USMC Small Wars Manual, 1940ed.  A classic how-to manual for those little problems that requre sending in the Marines. Still widely read; on the mandatory reading list for USMC officers. Much of the book is about re-establishing a state monopoly on violence. There are sections on """"disarmament of populations"""", and setting up a constabulary and a military government.

 """"The Modern Nation State and Regimes of Violence: Reflections on the Current Situation"""" . A recent paper on the subject by Kossler, a German academic writing for a Japanese audience. Pages 15-18 have a good summary of the history of the concept - Hobbs, Weber, Marx, etc. He views the """"monopoly on violence"""" as the result of the consolidation process which turned Europe from a collection of feudal regions into nation-states. Rather than trying to define """"legitimate"""" violence, Kossler speaks of the """"public dimension of violence"""".  Kossler also sees an economic dimension: """"The guarantee of sound market conditions therefore is also dependent on the  effective exercise of sovereignty by the state."""".  After covering the classic position, Kossler points out that non-state actors mess it up: """"The post-9/11 situation forces important and disconcerting qualifications on this rather conventional picture. This goes back to the fact that an act of outrageous violence emanating from a non-state source which cannot be defined in territorial terms has been interpreted as an act of war, to be countered by military means, including the targeting of certain state-bounded territories, such as Afghanistan and later Iraq."""" He also mentions the rise of """"networked organizations"""", including crime cartels that operate across borders, as challenging state monopolies on violence.
 In 2004, George Will wrote, about the US-Iraq war, """"The first task of the occupation remains the first task of government: to establish a monopoly on violence.""""  Because that effort wasn't successful, there's a lot of later material on what happens when the state can't establish a monopoly on violence. See also Arab Spring.

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.

Tyrannosaur grid diagrams
Hey, I saw you had done several other of the grid diagrams for some of the smaller coelurosaurs and was wondering if you had time to do some for the """"Big 5"""" tyrannosaurs. Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus don't have any... shouldn't be too hard, they're pretty identical. Tarbosaurus is grid-less too. Also, the ones currently on Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus (made by some other guy... not DINOguy, let alone DinoGuy2) have a weird scale... on *D* each grid square is .6m on each side, and on *T* they are .9m on each side. Seems like it would make more sense to be a square meter like you have. Plus they have a comma instead of a period, which no English-speaking country uses (this is English Wikipedia after all). So I guess if you have time, could you do those too? I would do them but I'm not sure how you get the outlines you use... do you draw them yourself or are they clipart from somewhere?

Hi Orangemike,

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

 Grace, The Chopper  
Since I have not seen much of a reference to this before, I thought it important to point out that Butch rides away on Zed's chopper named Grace. Grace is exactly what he has given Marcellus and, to a large degree, what Marcellus has given him after his rescue. This is in the original script and, I believe, another piece reinforcing the redemption theme so prevalent in this film. 
   Also it is interesting to note that Marcellus seems more interested in mercy and grace after, perhaps, and if,  he has received back his soul, which some allege was in the infamous briefcase. Ultimately, in the film, responding to grace becomes important when Jules redeems Ringo in the dinner and walks away from """"The Life"""". Vincent does not and ends up dead. Jules sees the miracle and grace and responds """"trying real hard, Ringo, to be the shepard"""".

Since I own all copyrights to The Gas Theory and Gravitation and any and all works by me, and you previously rejected these works,
I now prohibit you from posting any mention of these works other than that which I myself have posted.
you rejected my copyright yet I own those pages in question.
I am not and was not offended, however I deny Wikipedia as a credible source.
I have encouraged Google to produce """"encylopediactionary"""" all the worlds encyclopedias and dictionaries in one synopsis.
to prevent your site from destroying the worlds sources of reliable information.
your site is nothing more than a goofball run novelty.
your site has repeatedly rejected actual authors and actual people from correcting and publishing their real and true works.
you are a threat to the worlds supply of information.
It is shameful and sad to think how may people you have offended.
citations made by me to courts have been of information that I deemed worth to submit as written.
I however have seen and heard of the grave and serious """"editing"""" by your staff which has polluted honest submissions.
I recommend that you stop patting yourself on the back and realize your short comings.

I say to you all at Wikipedia cease and desist!!!
You must provide references to all the worlds collected resource and reference books!!!
you must correlate your articles with all the worlds encyclopedias and dictionaries !!!
you must at least provide the synopsis from each and every parallel and credible resource.
to assist in the selling of those works which have long stood to enlighten our world !!!
you must not continue on with your lollygagging mam-be-pambe malarkey bulldung freebie rally killing oddness.
I hope you all realize the real and true threat you pose to our world educational process.

 The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the """"purple patch that began with...,"""" etc.  This seems clear to me.

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

[Suggested Text]:

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received by this editor if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore some of Wikipedia's credibility on this subject.   Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.

 Arrested for Panhandling 

I was arrested in Nashville, TN at Church St. and George L. Davis Blvd.  I was not adequately told what I was arrested for.  I was kept in booking for 20 hours where I saw people are routinely and currently being kept for 72 hours and usually more.  The """"innocent until proven guilty"""" aren't allotted any beds, nor did the employees allow them to lie down.  I was told that I could plead guilty to something, I have no idea what, something about soliciting for business or ride.  No one employed in any part of this was capable of reading the statute aloud.  The public defender told me I could sit, literally sit, in booking for four days and nights until the officer was subpoenaed and then the case would be dismissed or I could be released that afternoon.  I volunteer a lot.  I was to be volunteering at the 2nd Annual Music City BBQ by then, and I cannot volunteer if I have been sitting for 96 hours.  I was arrested for and while sitting on a guard rail while holding a piece of cardboard with """"Hard Times / God Bless / Blessed Day"""" on it.  I was not provided with any documentation of my own of my having been arrested at anytime.  I was not told the offense for which I was being arrested.  One police officer said """"Soliciting"""" to me.  I was lied to with statements of """"You can find the statute underwhich you are being arrested at metro.com"""" and """"you can see what happened at nashvillemetro.com""""  I was not given any reason for why I was being arrested, and at least 20 cars drove by clearly listening in on the scanner to see what was going on.  I have no idea what they were accusing me of, whom the arresting officer was, whom the public defender was, whom the prosecuting attorney was, whom the magistrate was, nor whom some guy I have no idea what function is who told everyone that if they asked any questions of the magistrate that the magistrate would take unkindly upon them and would force them into further holding for non-competence.  This begging article lead me to believe that I would be okay if I pursued a legal and open venture.  The actuallity is quite the opposite.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please don't revert something without discussion after I undid it. I disagreed with your change to the Judicial activism article because I believe the sources don't make the same conclusion. You should use that as an invitation for discussion; but simply reverting it isn't appropriate in this circumstance. Please take the time to discuss the issue before reverting it.

About pronunciation and writing of Asiatic lion / Singh in Hindi

It is pronounced and written in Hindi as:  """"Sa"""" with a small """"Ee"""" ki Matra before it, with a point on top suggesting half """"Na"""" and then full """"Ha. 

As in English you cant write the exact word, after English came they wrote the word as """"Singh"""", but Gujaratis in Gujarat write and pronounce it completely different, its a different language. They write it and pronounce it close to """"Sinnh"""", their Sinh means Asiatic Lion too but is not spelled as or written the same as Hindi.

There is also a surname in Mair Rajputs which is Shinh, that is Asiatic Lion too, again it is different word but this is not a middle name, it is the actual surname / family name from Mair Rajputs.

Hope that helps

228d91c0ca07e17a,"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

WP:OVERLINKING policy on Wikipedia:Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead. If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.
 ...is to keep everything in a format that is uniform with everything... In my opinion, that's just impossible. Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems. When the list of track gauges, navbox track gauges, article titles and categories all mention 3ft 6in it is odd to use the devious 42in RailGauge template. Moreover, the Railgauge templates are only for conversion purposes and not intended for sorting lists by size or alphabet. Uniformity for the sake of uniformity serves no purpose.
Taking WP:NPOV, in particular WP:BALASPS in consideration, Rail transport in Disney Parks is not less or more significant than a randomly chosen rapid transit rail system, famous heritage railway, abandoned railway or extensively used common carrier railway. There are numerous other railways transporting huge numbers of passengers, preserving steam locomotives or having other notable features. And these aren't listed in the """"see also"""" section either. I chose the """"spamming"""" qualification for all your linking behaviour, not only the Disneyland links (see the section header).

I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on. So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldn't be a problem with it? Particularly, I imagine, if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it?

I read each of the candidates statements, and used that to judge if this question would be useful, look at the time between asking the candidates questions. Also look at the """"ignore all evidence"""" question, this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the """"5 days"""" question, plus this shows it was not a """"spam"""" question to all candidates, I did pay attention to their statements.

This is the question I posed to select candidates.
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the community's admins in this ANI? Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI?

Do these quotes;

ameliorate, add to or amplify concerns?

Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes?

If an essay WP:IGNORE ALL THE EVIDENCE were written, what concerns would be behind it, and what could be done about them?
If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days, then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates, substituting this with that example. Would that be acceptable?

Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before? Or is this the only one? Of course to answer that you would also have to answer; can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI? If you choose not to answer... is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do, or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Star Mississippi,

We created a great new social network site www.homestayonline.com for homestay enthusiasts. It is the first of its kind in terms of technology features and more including online chat, groups, forums, and more... I think that it is the first of its kind in homestay. I launched on April 9th and so far we have 40 members. I tried to add it a resource page to Wikipedia homestay subject but it was removed. I may have used the wrong method to add it and I apologize but if very tiresome to try again. I wonder if you can help me do right thing or add it for me in the most appropriate manner. I also hope that it would stay, since the HomestayOnline network is expected goal is to grow by minimum 50 members per day by end of 2009.

I would appreciate if you can also log-in my site and see for yourself how this can help everyone. It is free of charge to join...

Let me know!

 To bear in mind when writing articles """"Camera obscura""""  and """"Pinhole camera"""" 

Q. “Is a camera obscura the same as a pinhole camera?”

A. No. A pinhole camera is a type of camera obscura, as are all photographic cameras. The pinhole camera starts with a enclosed container (AKA the """"dark room"""") with a very small opening to let in the light. It is therefore a camera obscura. Cameras that use an actual pinhole size aperture are used to expose photographic film or paper but have limited use as viewing or drawing devices because the light that the pinhole admits is very dim and the image would be very hard to see. Most camera obscuras are made with lenses in the aperture since this makes the image much brighter and sharper. Room sized camera obscuras are sometimes made with lensless apertures but these openings are much larger than a pinhole. We have been told that an opening about the size of a US quarter can work well in some rooms.

 This article sounds like it was written by the UMWA 

It begins with adjectives like """"low"""" wages and """"poor"""" working conditions (against what standard?), and goes on from there.  I'm not saying that such those adjectives are wrong, simply that they are debatable (and have been debated for nearly a century).  It would be NPOV to say that the stikers were protesting their wages and working conditions, without the adjectives.  NPOV also requires a decent respect for the opinions of the owners who sincerely believed that unions were instigators of violence.

Also, unlike the prior comments in this discussion pertaining to certain unfortunate edits, I'm not saying that there weren't innocent and ill-willed parties in this event.  I'm simply suggesting that the history clearly coughs up both types of people on both sides of this conflict.

Abbott is primarily notable as a photographer, as the rescuer of the works of Atget, as somebody who argued for certain ideals in photography, and to a lesser extent as a didactic writer on photography, as a poet, etc. I don't think she's notable as somebody who did (or didn't) have various love affairs.

It's not so much about the English language. It's about concepts and logic.

No, I do NOT believe/think/know that I'm in the """"wrong"""" here. I wouldn't be talking about this if I thought I was wrong. Yeah, right. That would be pretty dumb! Puhleease!

And what would be supposedly encyclopedically """"wrong"""" with using a phrase like """"U.S. citizen""""? That's been a very accepted term to use, has it not? Why would you or most editors want to revert that back out?

Also, why would you guys as encyclopedia admin.s prefer to cater to the wide, but wrong, majority of people who lazily apply the wrong logic to a word rather than standing first with what's actually logically correct, and not bending to the popular vote just because it's what happens to be what most people (wrongly) think is the right way to say something? Aren't encyclopedias there to show people what the REAL truth is? Well then, why not with this simple terminology?

If I ask a Canadian (or Mexican, or Brazilian, or whatever) if she was an American and she said no, then despite what she thinks is her """"correct belief,"""" that so many other Canadians(/Mexicans/Brazilians) errantly believe, too (that shows what popularity does to muddy-up a fact), she'd be WRONG. If Canadians (/etc.) were to """"not be Americans,"""" then how could they possibly belong to a continent CALLED  AMERICA?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 95.7.140.82

Fair enough, mistakes happen. no problem ☺.
I am attempting to move this discussion to the talk page for the article in question, however, I will respond to the specific issues you seem to be having here.
You seem to be mincing terms (“view such fonts as Unicode” — reality is actually closer to the reverse of this statement), and (understandably) confusing very different subjects (characters, glyphs, fonts). I will try my best to address/explain what I assume to be the underlying issues (rather than just the symptoms).

The change I made to the article was nothing to do with fonts (that was only apparent to you specifically, the character exsited, and was likely downloaded sucessfully, but the font in use didn’t have a glyph to display it — the solution is simple: use a better font if you wish to see the glyph for the character). All I did was use the correct character (further discussion on the article talk page once I finish typing it).

Unicode is the standard character encoding these days, all others are now considered legacy. US-ASCII and ISO 8859-1 can both be treated/processed as UTF-8 (a character encoding for Unicode). Notable operating systems, and major applications in their entirity now use Unicode as their character encoding of choice, adding/allowing backwards-compatibility where needed (at least in good quality products/packages). This includes the majority of Microsoft products.
U+XXXX numbers are Unicode code points, an easy way to referrence specific characters without ambiguity, and need not concern the average person browsing the web.
Wikipedia pages are sent to you as UTF-8 (Unicode), so you’re ‘viewing them as Unicode’ anyway.
Fonts for US-ASCII/ISO 8859-1 are inter-changable in modern operating systems. The software with which you’re viewing this page is very likely written using Unicode character encoding (operating system & web browser).

Part of the reason for using the actual character natively in headings (on talk pages at least) was so that others could easily determine if their default system/browser configuration supported a more suitable range of characters, in order to be able to provide feedback about said character. It’s not like a missing glyph is causing an application failure (in which case I could understand your concerns).

Your claim that “My point is … about everybody else who can’t see the font correctly.” is seemingly baseless. Where is your evidence that anyone beyond yourself is having trouble seeing the glyph for this character? What about the people for whom the use of correct characters will help (those using speech-synthisis software)? If you can provide citation/evidence for this rather wild claim, I’d like to read it, otherwise I can’t help but feel you’re merely expressing your own wishes/preferrences/desires, dispite the other issues. What, beyond the issues you’ve encountered personally, are the reasons behind your disagreement with my changes? It seems that perhaps these articles are a little too close to your heart based on the nature and speed of your response(es) to the change.

“Article names here should be as simple as possible.” [emphasis; mine.]
No, article names should be as clear as possible, or as simple to comprehend/understand as possible, or provide for simplest readability. I suggest it may be worthwhile to read about the subject of usability (which is the dicipline concerned with making things easy to use).
Taking your argument further; should punctuation be removed too, as that would make titles much simpler, although less clear. Removing punctuation would mitigate the need to use percent-encoding in URLs, making MediaWiki itself simpler (although less flexible). I realise my example is counter-intuitive, but it was to emphasise the point that clarity, above all else is actually what’s important, not simplicity. A parallel example is user-interfaces; the most usable are not those which are simplest, but those which display the right information at the right time (clarity).

I’m familiar with how screen-readers function/operate. Not all ‘ride’ on top of the user’s browser. Blind people are not the only users of speech-synthisis software. 
Besides, you’re confusing the visual rendering of a charater (a glyph) with the character itself, and other representatinos/renderings of it (such as audio/speech). Modern screen-readers access the source-code of the page (the browser itself is just a vehicle to get to the desired page and/or aquire the source-code itself, along with the character encoding). So they’re given",0,0,0,0,0,0

    What is this source? Who wrote it? It looks like a hodgepodge of blurbs about antifederalists in PA pulled from somewhere, but I'd be interested to know by whom and from where this stuff was culled. As to the article text w.r.t. the Pennsylvania minority, presently it reads as follows:

        """"Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a one-man Pennsylvania """"minority report"""" published after the ratifying convention [cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs, with selected quotation from the """"minority report""""].""""

    At least until this discrepancy is sorted out, I would advocate changing the text of that passage to something like:

        """" Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania anti-federalist """"minority report"""" published after the state's constitutional convention: [followed by selected quotation from the """"minority report""""]

    Just to be cautious here, I'd recommend a citation to Uviller and Merkel, and another WP:RS representative of the position that the minority consisted of, what was it?, twenty-something participants/signers, whether they were in fact part of the convention or not. ... Kenosis (talk)

""""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman  to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romaniæ instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.""""

I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Comment  I'm seeing very strong support here; does anyone agree this is a case for a speedy delete?   
What? Been hearing voices, Kasreyn? Aside from your numerous comments Kasreyn, I don't see much support of your POV. 
Comment I wouldn't speedy delete this article. I disagee that this material is """"unreliable""""I think it is notable, and not designed to bias the subject any more than it would be to say that Charles Nelson Reilly is gay. That said, I do believe that the structural bias in the article title is unacceptable, so this article should probably be deleted, but its content merged with the main article. I think it's a biased attempt by fans of ICP to keep this information out of the main article, and that the creator of this article was taking a valid stand by creating it if ICP fans are putting their own POV in the article.  
Comment I'm not sure on what grounds you can propose to delete this article, or a remove it from the main ICP article. 
Comment It is that noteworthy and verified.  The text makes a reference to an interview in a magazine.  I have found the source of the material.  The article lists four references which are quite relevant information and are only there to make the article more substantial.  Personally, I am not a fan of the group or their style of music and do not care if the statements are true or false.  I am just trying to preserve the integrity of the article. If you can show me one valid reason for deletion, then I would consider supporting removing this from wiki.  
Save it I personally verified these sources, and they all exceed expectations. Riviting stuff people. >Riddlebox Wraithz 
Hold on per all the lovely comments above.  I don't think it's speedyible under wikipedian legislation at all. Northenglish 
Interesting It's interesting, and more than just POV since it's verifiably true.  It might be worth briefly mentioning it in the main ICP article as well.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity.

 Misrepresentation of Women in Football 

Hi Johan. I have some serious concerns about the (probably unintentional) misogynistic POV in Football Project articles and am hoping to enlist your cooperation.  I've attempted, over the past year, to begin correcting the biased POV by:
including women in football articles that previously made it seem as if only men play football or only men play well
creating new content/articles about women's football (e.g.: history, national teams and international competition)
wikifying articles related to women and football

I appreciate your passion for football and the enormous effort you've put into maintaining articles, the portal and the project.  But, it is disconcerting to find my work undone without so much as an attempt to collaborate or find ways to improve the representation of women in Wikipedia football articles. Reverting to the biased content on women's role in soccer (Football (soccer) culture article) as """"soccer mom or fan"""" is a violation of NPOV.  And removing the Norwegian Premier League for women link from the Women's football around the world article is counter-productive, in the most generous interpretation.  Perhaps it was not your intention to do anything POV.  I would appreciate if you'd collaborate.  Would you consider helping by finding a group of editors interested in improving the representation of women in football articles?  Thanks.  Deebki """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Adjusting for the known effects that finasteride has on prostate cancer detection, investigators estimated that high-grade tumors (Gleason scores 7–10) were no more likely in the men taking finasteride than in the men taking placebo. However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.""""
From this text, I think it would be appropriate to say something like - In contrast to the FDA's stance, the National Cancer Institute believes that finasteride may increase the ability to detect cancer which accounts for the higher prevalance of high-grade cancer.

Hey, how is it going? I am kind of stuck with a question about the population of a small place, and as I know that you deal with unincorporated small places sometimes I thought to drop you a line. I started that article about Randolph, Tennessee recently and I am so far pretty amazed that there is a lot of documented historical information to find about that place. Funny, if enough time passes, even about the smallest places there is something to say. Well, what I could not find out about is any recent population. As a matter of fact, I have a referenced population for 1820 (54), shortly before foundation of the town. And I have one good enough estimate for 1834 (1,000). In 1861 they had 5,000 soldiers there, but that does not really count as population, does it? Today it might be in the few hundreds, not much more. It looks like any population more recent than 1834 would be of great help here already.

I tried to find out about the voting precincts, but Randolph is included in the same voting precinct (14 S.W. Tipton) with a few other, larger communities. So you can't really start from there.

 Paragraphs vs section headers 

Sorry, didn't mean to imply it didn't have """"merit"""", any good faith edit on Wikipedia has merit. What I'm saying is, section breaks and paragraph breaks are similar, the question is when to use one vs the other. Paragraph breaks provide logical breaks in the content. In this case there is a new section header at the top of almost every paragraph, which is redundant, that's what paragraphs are made for. By adding those section headers, I believe, it chops up the article which discourages reading it as a single block of text from top to bottom, and encourages skimming and skipping, like reading an outline that hasn't been filled in, or a """"list of"""" sort of thing, rather than a chronological and somewhat inter-related history of the origin of the high five. If we thought those origin theories were going to be greatly expanded.. say 4 or 5 or more paragraphs each.. I could see section headers making more sense, but until then, I believe it reads better as a single block of text. Green Cardamom (talk) 
I see what you're saying, but I disagree. I think it looks better the way it is now, especially with the long block quote in the first section. I mean, the other option to me is bullets, but I think we both would agree that's not that aesthetically pleasing. Without some kind of division, it makes it harder to see that the three options are mutually exclusive, or arose independently at best. Without the divisions, in my opinion, it sounds like one origin narrative that all together led to the high five, rather than three separate possibilities.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Section 1b of the GACR states, """"it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections, layout, words to watch, fiction, and list incorporation."""" Refering to MOS:LAYOUT we are drawn to section 3.4 Notes and references. It begins """"For how to generate and format these sections, see Help:Footnotes and Wikipedia:Citing sources"""" Wikipedia:Citing sources aka WP:REF includes section 6.1 Variation in citation methods aka WP:CITEVAR. Extracted guidlelines of note from sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2:

To be avoided
 Switching between major citation styles, e.g., switching between parenthetical and  tags or between the style preferred by one academic discipline vs. another

Generally considered helpful
 Imposing one style on an article with incompatible citation styles (e.g., some of the citations in footnotes and others as parenthetical references): an improvement because it makes the formatting consistent

By following GA-criteria I am led, with no uncertainty, to a sound conclusion and made the reasonable request that all references be made consistent. They are currently a mixed bag of s and . Per WP:CITEVAR this is avoidable and unhelpful, and therefore unacceptable, in my opinion it fails the GAN requirement to follow MOS:LAYOUT closely enough. I will be failing this part of the GA nomination should the article remain a mixed bag, per WP:GACR which is built upon consensus that affects ALL of wikipedia and ALL GA nominations. A local consensus cannot seek to make an exception for one-off nominations, WP:IAR does not apply here.

 Dogs 

One question, how many dogs do you need to make a """"pack"""" ... three, four, five ... a dozen? Do they not live in three and fours too?

So, should it be, """"They may live in packs, fives, fours, threes, pairs, or singly""""?

The point I am making is this, you made a canonical statement in your summary, """"no evidence ... etc"""" but you did not provide any evidence or reference to sustain it in your edit. 

Can you do so?

The reason I am writing this is because I spent some time cleaning up and developing the Indian pariah dog topic, which I am sure you know. It's obviously a topic which you have some interest and passion in, perhaps even want to promote, which is a good thing. 

But isn't content on the Wikipedia supposed to be supported by references? You may well be right, but you know that's not enough.

I am actually interested in these kinds of dogs and would like to know more but there does not seem to be many academic or other reliable reference to support them. At least in the English language. A lack of dogs overseas means that there seems to be a lack of knowledge and acceptance of their heritage. I know a little more about Spitz types, Shibas etc, which are a little better studied.

A lot of dog and cat topics on the Wikipedia seem to be in bad shape. I'm thinking because they are written by their fans modelled on breeder pages, e.g. every breed appears to """"very intelligent"""". I've yet to read one topic that says the breeds are """"stupid and neurotic"""", and I've met a lot of stupid and neurotic dogs ... even if that's just the owners'/breeders' fault!

Too much work for me to consider taking on right now but at least the Indian pariah dog article is, I think, a little cleaner and in better shape now.

BTW, what are the Hindi/Indian language names for it? Pariah appears to be a Post-British thing. Is it just """"dog""""?

As the material I have restored to the section makes clear, this is not just a matter of three critics examining Rydberg's poems, nor is it sensationalizing.  While it would be inappropriate to examine the specific details of Rydberg's private life, his basic sexual orientation is a matter of absolute unanimity among all scholars and reference works that have considered the subject, and is an important aspect of Rydberg's life that should not be whitewashed or swept into the closet.  I would welcome a good-faith attempt by anyone to cast this material in a more acceptable light, as was suggested regarding the Thomas Mann article.  However, wholesale deletion of sources, insertion of misleading and deceptive quotes, and personal editorializing such as permeated the last edits to this section, should not be acceptable in any reference work.

However, I'm happy to change the transclusion if lots of people want the entirety of the information to be duplicated.

Do you mean you can read about those work conditions & not see that it's slavery?  Prepare yourself for earthshaking news: the wage system is slavery but most people didn't think so.  Slavery means """"someone who is controlled by someone or something.""""   A boss controls a slave, but a slave also enslaves a boss.   Being offered a wage you can't live on is slavery.   All jobs are being eliminated by machine-slaves,  which makes it more obvious than ever before that all people must have a Guaranteed Minimum Income, although I prefer the word 'residual' to 'minimum'.  Read child labour & try to see it was child slavery into the 20th century, & it still is today since many children work in their parents' business.  When they """"ended child labour"""" that didn't set the children free; they were """"free to starve"""" because what they need/ed is a GMI.  Having children is a form of slavery too: parents become slaves to their children (when they need to eat, bathe, etc) but the children are also slaves to their parents.  So """"no control"""" also means we'll always be slaves to needing food, & we can find ways to eliminate all the work with machines which again means all people need a GMI.  (Actually all people should own all things, because when a few rich people own everything it's obviously slavery; how did every person not know that?  America refused to let any attempts at Socialism & Communism succeed; instead they forced it to fail by starting many wars, teaching torture, & you must read Wm Blum's """"Rogue State"""".  Fidel Castro was right & America was wrong.)  And the BLS is wrong; they always underestimate, because most of those people are probably illegal immigrants from many generations back.  They say every year 50,000 people are smuggled into the US to work as prostitutes (that's slavery), so can you imagine how many illegals there must be in America hidden behind walls, & all supporting a few rich slave masters who travel the world & raise their families on the backs of SLAVES in America.  How can you read about multinational corporations & not see they cause poverty in those other countries, as well as in America?    If Liberia has a population of 3 million & one corporation goes there & """"creates only 2000 jobs"""" then can't anyone see the wage is causing their poverty??  That's just an example, but do you see what I'm saying about the wage is the problem worldwide, not the solution, like America thinks?  When 3,000 people show up to apply for 20 job openings, you know the wage is wrong & it's slavery.  I know I'm a slave, & I know every person is a slave & I'm right & everyone is wrong.  Gerry Spence also says we're slaves in Give Me Liberty.  That's all for now.    02:08, 31""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The article already reflects that historians disagree about when the institution of slavery was started, so no, I'm not opposed to it as long as it's properly sourced and is accurately reflected in the article. To use that language in regards to Punch's status or the significance of his court case is a violation of WP:NPOV and WP:OR. Like I've been saying from the beginning, find a reliable source and then the article can properly include that source. Like I've told you before, feel free to take this to dispute resolution if you want. I would, but you've made so many numerous red herring arguments that I wouldn't want you to suddenly feign ignorance and pretend that you never argued such a thing.

Re: the """"KKK"""" connection.  

As I recall, Napier forms a rebel group known as the """"Soldiers of Liberty,"""" but to maintain their cover, they only speak the initials of the organization.  I don't recall if we're told the Amtorian word for """"soldier,"""" but we do know that in their universal language, plurals are formed by adding a prefix, either """"kloo-"""" or """"kl-"""" depending upon whether the root word begins with a consonant or a vowel.  We do learn that the Amtorian for """"of"""" is """"kum.""""  Therefore, """"liberty"""" must either be a plural concept, or must begin with a """"k"""" anyawy.  So, the group is named the """"Kl-something kum K-something,"""" initials K-K-K!  We're told that's spoken kung-kung-kung on Venus rather than kay-kay-kay, by the kay ... er, way.

Wait a minute, on this basis, wouldn't just about every Amtorian organization have at least two K's in their initials? Wouldn't the K-K-K get confused with the K-K-P and the K-K-S-K and all the others.?  Hell of a way to carry on covert operations.  Sounds like that Monty Python bit about the Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea and the other splitters.  (""""What!  You're from the kung-kung-kung!  How dare you?""""  """"No, I said kung-kung-bung!"""")

Ergo, it would be pretty stupid to use actual initials given a language that uses kl- before every plural noun.  

Such a language ought to sound pretty awful, and to initiate choking in the speaker whenever a long passage is spoken, but never mind.  If a language expert like Tolkein had pulled something like this, you might infer a sinister motivation, but Burroughs never let logic get in the way of entertainment, and this served him and his readers quite well.

Napier smiles in amusement when his organization is rendered as K-K-K. Given my explanation, he should have laughed out loud.  That's hardly a political endorsement. Pursuing that track is S.O.L., and that ain't Soldiers of Liberty.   05:46, 3 August 2010 (UTC""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ice treaty?
This caught my interest:
According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price.
Anyone here have any idea if this was with an American company or with the Hudson's Bay Company, which maintained a post at San Francisco, though perhaps not this late (their post was at Yerba Buena (town) and had been founded in 1830.  The reason I propose the HBC is that there was a treaty - more than one - between the RAC and the HBC on the latter's provisions of dairy and meat and vegetables to Russian America; maybe there was a reciprocal agreement.  I can't imagine what treaty'' the RAC/Russia would have had with the United States that could have signed between 1824 and 1859....unless this has something to do with US support during the Crimean War?  Or??  If it's a contract with a private company (other than the HBC), then """"treaty"""" is not the right word to use.  if it's a corollary to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1839 or the earlier arrangements with either the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company  or some grandfathered contract re the agreement with Mexico over Fort Ross, somebody please explain....

Long does not give many speech like (to use the above example Bush) so one of a few would be: Notable. This convention was covered by USA Today. Notable. USA Today, to my knowledge, has not covered this convenion regularly, if ever. I could be wrong on that but I never remember it.

The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy, by being arrogant, lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop. His worrying obsession with NFCC#9 is his excuse for being a twat. he is deliberately making the workshop non-functional. For the IW to work properly we have to be able to either see or be able to link to the image being requested. Now Mr Dick esq comes along, deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request. In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank.

Getaway: Thank you for your comments. I most certainly did give my reasons  Read my previous comment. What you didn't do is raise any points on the discussion page before making changes. As for your charges:

1) FAIR and Media Matters are certainly media watchdogs, even though they're political. All media watchdogs are political. Rush Limbaugh is political. That doesn't make any of their views invalid, but it does call for balance. 

2) Phrases like """"axe to grind"""" serve no function in intelligent debate. It would be equally pointless to argue that Limbaugh has an """"axe to grind."""" He does, and I don't have a problem with that. He has every right to have an axe to grind here in the land of free speech, and so do FAIR and Media Matters. Having an axe to grind is just one way to say somebody takes a certain political position. Limbaugh's positions are one POV of a partisan debate and FAIR's are another. Their axes, excuse me, their views need to be balanced. By the way, I don't know as much about Media Matters as about FAIR, but FAIR makes no claim to be """"neutral and nonpartisan"""" as you suggest. What they claim is to be accurate. You're welcome to challenge that accuracy, with sources. Which leads to my next point:

3) It's very easy to toss out weasel words like """"MM and FAIR both have long records of inaccuracy"""" but you're not providing any evidence that their charges against Limbaugh are fallacious or inaccurate. Judging from Limbaugh's feeble response to FAIR's charges, we might be tempted to conclude that Limbaugh can't answer FAIR because FAIR got it right. If there's a problem with FAIR's accuracy, you're welcome to include it, with sources, in the paragraph. (I've issued this invitation three times already and nobody has taken me up on it.) But you do not get to blindly assert that FAIR isn't a credible source without any evidence to back you up, and you don't get to water down what I've written just because you don't like FAIR's work or because you can't find sources to back up your position.

4) FAIR isn't merely expressing opinion. It's documenting errors of fact. Please don't confuse opinion with fact, they're not the same thing at all. When Limbaugh claims that suspending rules on minority hiring will make earthquake repairs go quickly, he's stating an opinion. But when Limbaugh says the government suspended rules on minority hiring, he's making a statement of fact. FAIR is taking issue with Limbaugh's facts. 

5) I'm not asking for special treatment for FAIR. I'm asking that, as per NPOV rules, their view get equal treatment. Are you asking for special treatment for Limbaugh's views? 

6) Please focus on substance? I am. I feel it's important to provide a historical perspective on this controversy, and I feel the article needs to illustrate of the depth and scope of the controversy, which is provided by the Media Matters quote. I also feel this section needs a defining introductory sentence. For these reasons, I'm restoring much of the previous text. If you disagree, please take issue with me on this page. 

BTW I feel that Allen3 made a useful clarifying edit in an earlier revision, when he labeled FAIR a """"progressive"""" organization, and provided a link to an article. I find that much more accurate than """"Liberal,"""" since FAIR keeps its distance from classic liberalism, and sometimes takes issue with people who call themselves Liberal. Can we keep the """"Progressive"""" label?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Concerning point 1, Milburn is a student, by his own statement on his Wikipedia page, studying philosophy in Lancaster. What could possibly be insulting in saying that he is a student, while I myself have been ... (not relevant)? I expect some respect from someone who could be my own child if not student. 

 Concerning your point 2, please read my talk page, and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn, I have just stated facts. Milburn has been writing to me that he is a """"dedicated"""" and """"experienced"""" editor. Why should this have been relevant to me? I had already told him, in no uncertain terms, that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon. Yet, Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor, he was also experienced. All these, in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary! I had just said that we, i.e. I and Milburn, disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else. Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me? Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things! 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster? In point of fact, University of Lancaster has one of the best, if not the best, laboratories of law-temperature physics world-wide. If there are ten great low-temperature physicists in the world, thee of them are in Lancaster (they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory; they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator, etc.). No, you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster - some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there (I even was their guest sometimes ago), one of them also a mathematician of great international standing.

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J. Milburn as a person, as well as about his contributions (I simply do not know his and his contributions). I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion. That is why I suggested to him, already yesterday, that rather than arguing, we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle. That is all, insofar as I am concerned. It is J. Milburn who has kept filling my talk page with his messages after messages, telling me that I were wrong and that I did not understand certain things. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I notice that this RfC is dead but SH just removed a sock's comment. I actually do think this conversation is fine staying open since there is not consensus and inclusion v not is essentially WP:FREQUENT. I did not notice NickCT's comment until now but wanted to address it since we have already gone over this but people seem to forget or have to rattle it off everytime it comes up. I for one think """"massacre"""" in some form should be mentioned in the lead. Unfortunately, the assertion that it is what """"people involved call it"""" is contradicted by the following:
Gaza Victory: enough said but just a reminder, it can't be a massacre and a victory can it?
""""Gaza Massacre"""" has been disputed as a title with the sources mirroring its forced use on Wikipedia
Hamas did not have an official name for it. This has been discussed and it is a point conceded by those in favor of inclusion. Hamas simply did not use its limited PR capabilities to clearly lay this out as their preferred title (see point 1).
But back to my point of keeping this open. I have offered two solutions. Nableezy has rejected at leas one of them. 
Include """"it has been called a massacre"""". No bold. Not an alternative title. Just simply lay it out there. One editor recently provided a source calling it """"Massacre in Gaza"""". It was obviously referred to as a massacre. 
or
Include every title that was verifiably used in RS at a ratio of tens of thousands to one. This could be accomplished by actually adding information in the lead about the media and its relation t this topic. This would increase the quality of the article by meeting WP:LEAD] by being an actual summary. 
I'm not going to lie, I think it is time to change the title of this article altogether.  notice that other language's Wikipedia projects refer to it as the Israeli operational name (some editors have equated this to POV even though it is a very common and accurate title) or one laying out the dates and calling it a conflict (as we used to do but it was really long). That discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). But it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and POV dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. Two easy options are presented to you. It is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. And add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. Day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Explanation of blocks 
Blocking is a serious matter. The community expects that blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested. 

 Notifying the blocked user 
Administrators must supply a clear and specific block reason which indicates why a user was blocked. Block reasons should avoid the use of jargon as much as possible so that blocked users may better understand them. Administrators should also notify users when blocking them by leaving a message on their user talk page unless they have a good reason not to. It is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.

When implementing a block, a number of pro forma block reasons are available in a drop-down menu; other or additional reasons can also be added. Users can be notified of blocks and block reasons using a number of convenient template messages—see Category:User block templates and Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst you're not likely to get too many defenders of FGM here, the need for the policy should be clearer for articles like abortion, for instance.

You, like 'Dodo', are wrong.  Notice that 'Dodo' hasn't bothered to EXPLAIN, in  detail, his actions.  This is quite revealing!  He must know that I am a 'new' user:  Only on for about two weeks.  Logic suggests that he should, carefully, EXPLAIN why he did something like deleting my posts, repeatedly, without even as much as asking the community.  After all, why should he be RUDE, as he has been, when he cannot claim that I 'should know' not merely what the rules say, but also the way they are followed.  Well, the simple answer may be that he does this kind of thing a lot:  He may ORIGINALLY have been respectful, but maybe he's developed a practice of 'drive-by-edits'.  He seems to have that reputation!  But as tempting as it may be to assert that, I think his actions are far more detailed and specific, and malicious:  His pattern of deletion of my posts is to delete ALL ALL ALL of my posts, not merely some fraction that (he would argue) violates some rule. So, the 'rule' (actually, the practice) he seems to be showing is this:  """"Do not allow James Dalton Bell to post ANYTHING, on any article, and certainly not on 'jim bell'.""""  Will 'Dodo' deny this? So far, he's avoided commenting!  'Dodo' seems to do this by simply finding SOME reason to dislike my post (even just a small part of it, though he doesn't say), and then use this to 'justify' deleting everything.  The best explanation, I  think, is that somebody has put him up to it, and he wasn't careful enough to cover his tracks.  And, a few other non-thinkers back him up.

Yes, not necessarily after every sentence especially if the sentences deal with the very same thing and this is a very long article. Every paragraph should have one though.

I'm not criticizing the work done on this article, I'm just worried because I want to let it stay as FA-class. I think part of the problem could be that the article might be getting too long. For such a general presentation on the war, not every section has to be very exact. It makes citating harder and some of the chapters look really long which doesn't make them look too attractive to read.

I love Short Circuit 2; the first was good, but for some reason the second had more charm...even if it was a poorer made movie. I was never big into Disney. I think my favorite as a child were The Lion King and Rescurers Down Under-maybe even The Great Mouse Detective. Too much singing for my tastes. I'll take Nightmare/Christmas over The Little Mermaid. Speaking of which, Nightmare/Christmas was just released in 3-D. Toy Story was awesome...lol, I was just reciting some dialogue to the first one two nights ago. I was thinking about buying them. I don't remember seeing the second film all the way through.   (Contact me) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her """"why... why.. why..""""... but now she is calling it """"obscene,"""" and offers to show it to any admin.

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Sundostund

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

 Sanction being appealed  Banned from editing for 1 week, for edit warring and breaching WP:ARBMAC rules

 Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.

I am completely aware that I made a mistake when I entered an edit war yesterday. I also know that I am blocked because I breached WP:ARBMAC rules. I completely recognize my guilt here. All of that was very stupid thing to do, and I promise that I will not continue to do that.

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This body of air has to be large (many chord lengths in diameter, say five or more), for the effects of the airfoil on the boundary to be small enough to be negligible (from a practical point of view; a case which not satisfies this is the ground effect where the boundary influences the kinematics and forces).    11:21, 28""",0,0,0,0,0,0
0e21a99d0895fe48,"Thanks for the speedy reply and the links. After mining through about 20 or thirty none seem to indicate a clear consensus on the issue of what is or is not a minor edit. There are some agreement regarding specific examples where the edits being made where disagreed upon such as Template redirects or date delinking but not much outside that clearly agreeing an edit as minor. As I mentioned before I still think that someone needs to establish clearly what is considered a minor edit, perhaps in a table form, that can be added too (or removed) as needed rather than a vague catch all description.

For example, after reading the many of the discussions I can see that there does seem to be agreement that removing blank spaces or changes to casing are minor and shouldn't be done alone. Aside from those 2, the rest where argued both ways and it appears that the more technical users won the arguments by force of will and access rights.

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

1. The Forgotten was released as an official single for the Twilight soundtrack. I think most people remove it because they think it was a ¡Tré! single, which it wasnt. Green Day announced a while back, along with Twilight, That it would be the soundtracks lead single.
2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion. And as for the other we had an agreement a while back to keep this one but people have started removing it again. This was a collaboration from Green Day and Husker Du. It was an """"official released Split single"""". One side was the original version and the other Green Days version from """"Warning"""". But either way both are sourced and the source is reliable and many other sources on this page come from this site as well. 
This one I dont see any complaints about. It never had a war to remove and only was reverted a while back. Various other ones have this section and its not that long. So it doesnt make the page to huge and not every discography """"has to have one"""". I dont think that this is a problem and it really does make the article more complete.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified.

I can't quite agree with the philosophy.  I think """"announce on the noticeboards,"""" and then you can talk to people like a normal human with normal conversation on IRC, if you're going to be there anyway.  Fundamentally, though, IRC is not part of Wikipedia: it's part of Freenode.  Wikipedia's rules are suspended there, including keeping a history, open editing, etc.  Therefore, if you announce first on IRC, you have, effectively, not announced at all.  I've tried to avoid taking such a draconian line, but that is the actual line.  In the meantime, knowing that people will say things as soon as they notice them, and, if they're on IRC at the time, they'll say it first there, the biggest thing is that every IRC user needs to know that whatever is said there simply hasn't been said at all, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.
My talk page should be mysterious to anyone who hasn't seen the logs of en.administrators.irc from Christmas Eve.  For myself I will say this much: I don't get actually angry very often, and when I read those logs I was enraged.  That should say something.  No doubt that argument doesn't look helpful, but I'm willing to go through it and look bad, if necessary, to get people to stop sniping from behind a screen.  If they want to denigrate me, want to spend time characterizing """"idiots who complain,"""" then they should do so where they have to be subject to the same """"assume good faith"""" and """"civility"""" and """"no personal attacks"""" rules that they have blocked people for (repeatedly).  
I was working on this essay prior to Christmas Eve.  All that did was turn up the heat and encourage me to focus both on general best practices and the fundamental abuse that is en.administrators.irc.  IRC has some rationale.  The en.administrators.irc has none whatever that I can see.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Closing of requested move at 100,000 BC (Doctor Who) 

Hey, Nightstallion.  You recently closed a requested move of 100,000 BC (Doctor Who) with """"Not moved, vote is evil, evidence is inconclusive.""""  Could you expand on that a bit, either at the talk page or at Wikipedia:WikiProject Doctor Who#100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child (where the move was being discussed in an effort to reach consensus before the RM was filed)?  I think I understand your reasoning, but given that three of five votes — and five of seven comments by contributors — were in favor of the move, it would be helpful to have a bit more explanation of your judgement.  (To summarize the arguments: no title was given on-screen for the story.  Production documents from the time of broadcast refer to it as """"100,000 BC"""", but these were not widely known about for many decades.  A novelization, video release and (next week) DVD release all use """"An Unearthly Child"""", the name of the first episode of the story.

As I was saying, the article was created as a WP:POVFORK:
It represents the nationalist POV that Partisan movement in Slovenia were somehow separate or exceptionally autonomous from the rest of the Partisan movement. Which is incorrect.

Thank you for that response, and I will benefit from the additional information. I do however believe the entire reporting process is better served if this unintentional obstruction is corrected. Regardless of whether or not a report would have been more appropriately filed somewhere else, the misplaced report having been filed in good faith, deserves to receive the attention on an admin. Honestly, I would expect an admin to rather zealously ensure, that they weren't taken out of the loop, by the flaw of an automated process. I believe the timestamp should be compared, and if the report is after the block in place, the report should stay. Manually remove if without action, or when the block is modified, the Bot would remove it then. Unless it was a technical challenge beyond what I can fathom, I see little reason not to.

You can see for yourself that there has never been a consensus at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Hebrew) and Wikipedia:WikiProject Hebrew languages and that therefore Wikipedia respects Hebrew as it is used and spoken by both Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews, by modern Israelis as Modern Hebrew and as in Biblical Hebrew.

No, the statement is accurate. It's a verfiable fact (for which there's no shortage of evidence) that there are no pro-ID peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals. The only controversy is that created by the Discovery Institute's list, which you first posted here before deleting it.

Discovery Institute claims there are peer reviewed ID articles. But the DI's list has been long debunked:  It's also easily verifiable by searching the relevant scientific pub DBs. Further, if you read the Kitzmiller trial transcripts, Behe, one of ID's top proponents stated under testimony that """"""""there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred."""", a fact noted in the judge's ruling and the article here. Based on Behe's testimony alone the DI's claim is discredited and supports the """"To date, the intelligent design movement has yet to have an article published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal."""" sentence .

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1,0,0,0,0,0

I'm going to include a link to the article here just because it's a nice thing to do.  Rachel Tzvia Back.  This way, if either one of us needs to refer to the article, it's only a click away.  No need to search for the article.
Okay, now that that's done, you can definitely use the same reference more than once!  It's easy to do.  This is covered at Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners but I'll cover the main points here.  The first time you use a reference, it will look something like this:
The Earth is round.Reference info goes here
Then when you want to use it again:
It is mostly covered by water.
You basically just re-use the first part of the reference tag again but put in the ending / character.
And you can definitely say that she is married with three children, if you have a reference.  We often tend to leave out children's names for the sake of the privacy of the child.  The names of the children of very well known celebrities are often included, for example Angelina Jolie or Gwyneth Paltrow because the kids names are already mentioned in so many news stories about them.  But someone who is not quite so famous, like Back, usually has the names left out.

IIIspirit, I was not vandalizing your criminal site, I was contributing information within the intent and purpose of the article; informing the public about the new versions based on experience of installing computer programs, uninstalling computer programs, demonstrating programs, and giving instructions on use and maintenance of programs on many people's computers for well over a year, besides personal experience, especially in the recent times involving Mozilla Firefox version 7.0. Also, information given to me by the people whose computer I worked on in the past, who had upgraded to the 7.0 version, they stated the same flaws that I faced.  You were only giving half the information, and I the other half that you are trying to hide from the public to defraud them (this is based on your deleting this vital information that contributed to, and completed the article within the intent and purpose of the article). You were giving only the so called good qualities of the newer versions, but not the serious time consuming flaws (see below that which was listed in your article that you failed to mention, and do not want known).  

If one is working on the internet, on the old Mozilla versions there is tabs on the toolbar of the internet sites you are working on. If you should quit the internet a window appears asking if you want to cancel this action, quit, or quit and save tabs. By saving tabs, any time in the future when you pull up the internet there is the tabs, and you can take up where you left off. On the newer version of 7.0, this action is not available. You lose your work, and have to start all over again from the beginning. This is a severe cost of time. On the old versions, by the search window (http://) is three arrows, one pointing to the left, one to the right, and one pointing down. This last one allows one to see recent sites visited, and one can choose one by looking at the list that is presented. This is time saving. However, on 7.0 version this button is deleted, thus costing one time. Also, 7.0 version is not compatible with Youtube download toolbar, and will disable it. Also, when you upgrade,you will lose any history you have. The important information contained in the history list will be lost forever. 

These flaws not only should be listed giving a complete informing article that informs and stays within the intent and purpose of the article, but, as all ready stated completes the article. 
It would be like stating that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and that's all. My addition would be like giving the underlying causes that led to this act. This portion you would strive with your upmost efforts to hide and keep from the public.
When a person only tells half the story then it is a lie, and if one does this with the intent deceiving the general public into taking a seriously flawed piece of trash, then it becomes fraud. With marketable product such fraud is a criminal act. I strongly feel that such criminals as yourself should be removed from our society by the courts to prevent your harming the innocent public.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 From what I have been able to see when looking at  he only likes captions like B-57 in a hanger and B-57 flying - useless information.  Captions should spell out who, what, when, where (this a the basic when taking an class on basic writing).  Real aviation historians want details - I say as a aviation historian that if you have a photo then you have to give its history.  Bill say that this information should be spelled out in the artile, fine - lets delete all photo captions and go back to cave paintings.

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  03:40, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev",0,0,0,0,0,0

In any case, and as I leave the discussion in this page, I did not get any feedback and therefore cannot be sure that my statements that thepatientcapacitor.com posts I linked to, were even examined within the Wikipedia entries were they are, and if anyone agrees they enrich Wikipedia for its readers.

Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.""""

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

 Will Arbitration finally be needed to stop the bigoted attacks?  

I fear that certain editors here have not heeded the recent warnings whatsoever and are proceeding full steam ahead with attempting to make this Bible article a full fledged one-sided POV job, with insulting, inflammatory, and derogatory rhetoiric being directed at all those who take this story seriously.   There is only one way to get this travesty to end and that is with more level of arbitration.  We know there are anti-Christian and anti-Jewish bigots in the world: always have been, no doubt about that.  Why do we have to allow them to come here and spout their intolerance non-stop. The way these sad sacks look at Christians and Jews whom they always label with derogatory sounding labels like """"fundamentalist"""" and """"conservative""""  is reminiscent of the way Hitler felt about Jews except these mental dwarfs include Christians as well, involving a much greater proportion of the population as their target.  They are poisoning the environment with their bigotry. This is a plea to arbitration for remedy.  /talk/ """,1,0,0,0,0,0

This is NOT the correct definition of queer.  According to the free dictionary dot com, queer is """"Deviating from the expected or normal; strange: a queer situation. 2. Odd or unconventional, as in behavior; eccentric. See Synonyms at strange.""""  And according to Merriam-Webster, queer means """"a  differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal. b (1)  eccentric, unconventional (2)  mildly insane  touched.""""  And according to common sense, queer is not exclusive to """"sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual, heteronormative, or gender-binary

you demanded some facts.  here you go;
Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953, but 1950.  most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953.  it is definately wrong. if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents, you will see he was born 27 March 1950.  he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17.if he was born in 1953, it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible.  

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karataş' group was based in Istanbul.[3]

this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a """"fact"""" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.

Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. 

This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  

In prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]

He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      

He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]

Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]

following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.

this is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I wasn't to know that what you had done was copyediting for FAC, because you hadn't stated that you had made those changes on the FAC talk page. I was getting confused because the reviewers are telling me to do something, then I'd go to change it, and I couldn't find what it was that they wanted changed, so I couldn't tell them that it has been done. I'm not saying I don't appreciate your help, but a lot of what you had removed hadn't been listed as things that needed to be removed on the FAC talk page, meaning that they clearly think it is fine as it is, and was also information which I was told to include during the GAN process; thus you was removing content which made it a GA in the first place, such as in the lead. I prefer to do things myself, so I know what's been done and what needs to be done so i can keep track of things, and I kinda feel like it is my responsibility to make the changes considering I nominated it, that's just my opinion. And I did assess each of your edits, I looked at them all, but it was easier for me to undo all of them so I could start from where I left off. Don't take this offensively! • 999

It's not connected to the Arab world in the same way that the Arab states are connected to each other, and is only included by dint of being a Middle Eastern autocracy.  But I believe that WP:COMMON should be our guide, and in this regard, media seems to be contrasting Iran with the Arab countries, rather than including them.
I ran a Google News search for """"Iran Arab Spring"""" and will list a run-down of the treatment by sources on the first page:
The Christian Science Monitor refers to """"protests sweeping the Arab World"""".
The Huffington Post refers to """"another spring on the Iranian scene."""".
The next two articles, and two later down talk about the threat posed by Iran to the Arab Spring,  or Arab World 
The next article talks about Blackwater for some reason. 
Jerusalem Post calls its article """"Arab spring, Persian winter."""" 'Nuff said.
The BBC includes Iran with China and Azerbaijan as related protests. 
The AFP (Whatever that is) says that Iran is different from the Arab countries, but also uses Arab spring to refer to the protesters there.  At four days old, it's the second oldest source on the front page. 
The oldest article, coming from The Telegraph, doesn't provide any indications either way.

On the other hand, anybody who has been to the US would know that competition is intense between universities and rankings are very popular (for good reason) in the US.

Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered """"Catholic"""", so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term """"hardcore.""""  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.  However, the question of the Rosary sort of gets to the heart of the matter.   00:22, 11""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The prophecy in Daniel about Antiochus is an example of vaticum ex eventu.  Daniel is known, in the form we have it, to have been written pseudepigraphically in the 2nd century BC (the Aramaic middle chapters may be a century or so earlier) during Antiochus' persecution of the Jews 1, 2, 3 (also see Encarta, Albertz 1988, Dever 2001, the Jerusalem Bible's introduction, probably any introductory textbook to biblical studies); I took out the reference to the prophecy because 1) saying there is a mysterious prophecy that some believe refers to Antiochus is misleading; the prophecy does refer to him, because it was written during his reign retroactively, and 2) stating this in the article will generate an edit war with evangelicals, which is bad for the quality of the article.  Therefore, since it is a peripheral detail, I believe it is best left out of the article; it is dealt with in the Book of Daniel article, which can be linked to the article on Antiochus.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi!  I'm leaving you this message because you are listed as a Wikipedian in Louisiana.  The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at Louisiana State University, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.

Prior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).

 Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a """"final process"""" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's """"use it to tip people on social media"""" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.

 """"Empire discography"""" page / """"Singles and songs"""" section 

Hi everyone,

I'd like to suggest that there is either a new page for the discography of 'Empire' OR instead of listing the soundtrack etc., just another page called """"Singles and songs"""" (like what they've done with the TV show 'Nashville' at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_discography#Singles_and_songs)

I'm happy to start working on this as I think it'd be a good way for people to be able to quickly find a song they're looking for, what episode it was in, who performed it etc. Thoughts?

Map in the Politics Section

What the hell, that thing looks ridiculous. Look, we can include Maryland and Delaware as being """"part of the South"""" to humor those not living in reality, but only on a token basis. We're not actually supposed to try and integrate the two states into Southern society when they really don't belong!

That being said, the map of Southern electoral votes is completely absurd. You've got this big red mass with a tiny little speck of blue at the top that obviously doesn't belong, but we're just going to pretend like Maryland and Delaware aren't two of the most heavily Democratic states in the whole damn country. 

Now, let's see, politically, who would be a closer match to Maryland and Delaware? Why, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island...

Oh, all Northern states. 

Like I said, I'll pretend, for the sake of mollifying the hard-liners, that Maryland and Delaware are """"border states."""" Everyone knows, though, that they're actually not, and including them in an article about Southern politics, when their own political sentiments are so flagrantly Northern, is silly.  Somebody please fix or remove this map, as it's misleading.

 General message 

Hi, Tournesol! This is just a general message you don't have to reply to, but it would be greatly appreciated if you do.

I know what I have done at SVWP, and I have done many things wrong there. And yes, I have been trolling a few times. The problem was I didn't even think about a permanent block. I simply thought that if you were contributing constructively (no vandalism), you are welcome. But, I should've read sv:Wikipedia:Det är ingen rättighet att redigera på Wikipedia (English: Editing at Wikipedia is not a permission). If I had thought about my behavior at SVWP, I would probably have """"skärpt mig"""" (pulled myself together?) and really shown who I really am.

I am a normal user, but I just want you to know I am completely aware of my behavior at SVWP, which caused my permanent block. But please, please leave me alone from ENWP now. I know I am welcomed back to SVWP in a little less than three years. I have been behaving better here during the last month or so, and I have completely stopped engaging myself in WP:SPI and reporting you at WP:AN/WP:ANI, but please focus on more constructive things than just mentoring and preventing me from getting tools at ENWP. I currently do not feel I need a mentorship from you. (Sure, if I am trolling somewhere at ENWP, feel free to revert it.)

Vertebrobasilar Stroke Study Findings
There was an association between chiropractic services and subsequent vertebrobasilar artery stroke in persons under 45 years of age, but a similar association was also observed among patients receiving general practitioner services. This is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissection-related neck pain or headache seeking care before having their stroke.

Hence, there is no difference in association between stroke and DC and MD visits.  This suggests that VB strokes are not necessarily caused by SMT or a visit to the DC but that they are already in progress prior to the visit.  It should also be noted that there are 2 MDs involved in this study in case the argument of bias comes up.  It will be interesting what CynRN and the stroke fear mongers have to say now that the evidence disputes their beliefs.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Something these admins have clearly not read 

It's clear from the reckless disregard shown towards Chooserr that the admins of wikipedia are failing to read the materials provided for their education.  In this case the Wikipedia:Controversial_blocks page.  The copy below has emphasis provided where the admins in this situation are failing:

Wikipedia:Controversial blocks
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

While blocking IP addresses responsible for anonymous, clear-cut vandalism is routine, many other uses of IP and username blocks are contentious. Where consensus proves elusive, such blocks are damaging to the community.

The most controversial blocks are blocks of:

 suspected """"sock puppets"""" or """"reincarnations"""" of banned users
 logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions,' regardless of the reasoning for the block
 blocks made under the disruption provision of the blocking policy.
 blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.

Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for | controversial blocks is:

 Check the facts with care.
 Reread' appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy.
 If possible, contact other administrators informally to be sure there are others who agree with your reasoning. The administrators' noticeboard, IRC and email are effective tools for this.
 Place the block, exercising due care in the wording of the """"reason""""  message, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked.
 Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies.
 Be willing to discuss the block with other Wikipedians. Such discussion usually takes place either on the blocked user's talk page, or the administrators' noticeboard (the latter especially in those cases where it was already raised there).

Block wars, in which a user is repeatedly blocked and unblocked, are extremely harmful. They are a source of frustration and disappointment to many seasoned Wikipedians and tend to encourage further bad behavior on the part of the blocked user. Avoid them. Instead, discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensus.

If no consensus has emerged after several respected Wikipedians have reviewed the matter, the user should be left unblocked.

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

(P.S. - As I think about it, in truth, the onus should really be on the maintainer of the linked sites to ensure that anyone that got to that URL would knowin terms that the site author wants folks to knowthat it """"should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""".... hmmm...

The article says 

""""Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has observed Kanzi in communication to his sister. In this experiment, Kanzi was kept in a separate room of the Great Ape Project and shown some yogurt. Kanzi started vocalizing the word """"yogurt"""" in an unknown """"language""""; his sister, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt.[5] """".

Now in this case, TG, there is a clear misrepresentation of the source, which reads 

""""In one experiment she described to me, she placed Kanzi and Panbanisha, his sister, in separate rooms where they could hear but not see each other. Through lexigrams, Savage-Rumbaugh explained to Kanzi that he would be given yogurt. He was then asked to communicate this information to Panbanisha.""""Kanzi vocalized, then Panbanisha vocalized in return and selected ‘yogurt’ on the keyboard in front of her,""""Savage-Rumbaugh tells me.""""

These accounts are substantially different, as you can see. 

In the source, S-R explains to Kanzi. through lexigrams, that he 'would be given' yogurt - in the article, he is 'shown' the yogurt.

In the source, Kanzi is asked to tell Panbanisha that he would be given yogurt, in the article he isn't.

In the source, Kanzi simply vocalizes; in the article, he vocalizes in an """"unknown 'language'"""".

Why is the wiki article simplified in this way ? Because the claims in the source are incredible. As far as I know, lexigrams do not include words such as 'would', so S-R can't tell Kanzi that he 'would' be given yogurt. Secondly, Kanzi is supposed to understand 3000 spoken English words (that's according to the wiki bonobo article, which references (guess what) the same Raffaele article we're talking about), so why does S-R need to use the lexigram at all ?

More importantly, both the article and the source refer to this 'experiment'. It would be nice to know the details of this experiment, which might describe how many objects Kanzi was shown, how often he vocalized, and how many times Panbanisha responded with accuracy, and so on.

I can't find this experiment. Tonight I contacted the Great Ape Trust, where S-R works with Kanzi, and asked for the reference. I'll let you know what they say. I'll leave off amending the article in the meantime.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Losmejorescd.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  
I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out? If it was editing logged out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual restart after a block.  If it was editing logged-in, then the """"kill switch"""" isn't working.  So, no matter how you look at it, something's not working right.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

Hey David.  If you have time for an article can you create one about Agnes of Aquitaine, the second wife of Ramiro I of Aragon and the daughter of William VI or VII of Aquitaine?  But you would have to be a little creative about naming her because there is already a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre and a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon, and this Agnes' birth and death date are unknown.  
Just doing that.  I'm going to clean up the entire list.  
Just create a stub. Check Isabella of Urgel's article, it's as short as Agnes' article will be and she had a son who was king.  
Thanks David.  You did a fantabulous job. You probably should change the first paragraph to show how her indentity is disputed and how the indentity of her father is disputed between William VI and William VII.  
I don't know. I wish he'll take it less seriously, I mean I can't put any dates that are historically guessed.  He and Srnec are the same.  He seem to only altered Agnes' page but Ermesinda's page seems pretty intact with a few arrangement changes. BTW have you checked any of my new lists, you can check some out at Category:Lists of countesses, Category:Lists of duchesses, Category:Lists of princesses, and Category:Lists of queens.  
I moved it. As for Majorca, it'll be finished after I added the independent queen consorts.  Do you think another page should be created for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy since Agnes, wife of Ramiro I of Aragon isn't really even on both Agnes?  Agricolae removed all the children of the Savoyard Agnes of Aquitaine.  
Yeah I saw that connection of Bertha and Agnes, but we can't be sure if there were one or two Agnes.  We can just say how they may be the same person.  
I don't really care anymore, he must have been easedropping into our conversation.  I hate arguing because in the end I always lose. One bad thing about me is that I'm a pushover.  Well List of Majorcan consorts is done, in time I'll create another section for the titular queen consorts and another section for the Ladies of Balaguer.

But if Atrian likes to hear himself talk so much he should find someone who cares about what hes saying.  I hope im not offending you.  But like i said ive been a memeber for 3-4 days and this guy is been leaving me nasty comments since the first article i posted.  Thanks.  I also wonder how Atrian knows that i didnt have promision to use that text.?   Wouldnt it be possible that i know the webmaster that wrote it for the goverment page that i copied it from?

How come these idiots, who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical references/citations, be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas? It is  also amusing to learn that such-like dorks are trying to define the historical out-lines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia! It is highly desirable that these fuck'in self-styled Wikipedia administrators/commentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references. Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People. Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject. It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history? It is first necessary that these adminitrators/editors like Fuck'n Dabbu and his ilk, first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj history-only then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the Kambojkas?'.And, I'll see how long these ignorant, prejudiced-minded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia?????''.

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0,0,0,0,0,0

You adjust your meaning of """"factual information"""" to fit your particular brand of socialist bullshit. Just because Leithp is less of a """"Wiki Facsist"""" is not a glowing statement either.

 Lead section 

The consensus is that the lead section needs to be shortened (see #Proposed intro) even though I disagree with the others on the degree of shortening. Please stop adding text to the lead section! 

Some text I removed/modified:
""""is a state that is composed of the island groups of Taiwan, the Pescadores, Kinmen, and Matsu."""" > """"is a state that currently has jurisdiction over the island groups of Taiwan, the Pescadores, Kinmen, and Matsu."""" This is inspired by the proposal above. The former adheres to Chenism and is POV. Whether the ROC=Taiwan is subject to debate. I don't see how the latter can be disputed.
""""Some people view the current ROC that exists on Taiwan as the continuation of the ROC state that from 1912 to 1949 exercised sovereignty over all of China. Others view the state on Taiwan as existing separately from Republican China."""" > """"From 1912 to 1949 the ROC encompassed all of China."""" Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words. who are these """"some people"""" and """"others""""? The sentence is too ambiguous to be useful. Again, I don't see how the latter shorter wording is POV or inaccurate. 
""""modern Republic of China"""" > """"existing Republic of China"""". """"existing"""" is less ambiguous than """"modern"""". when does """"modern"""" begin? It also smacks less against the PRC's version of events.
""""warlordism"""" > """"warlordism"""". why the dewikification? the link is relevant.
removed """"which had been reclaimed from Japan in 1945"""". this is not an article on Japan. space is limited. why does this belong in the lead? This is in the history section.
""""the KMT set up what it called a provisional capital in Taipei"""" > """"the KMT declared Taipei the provisional capital"""". the latter is much shorter. the POV of regarding Taipei a provisional capital is alleviated by using the word """"declare"""". The KMT declared. That is not disputed, even not by the PRC.
""""the Communists proclaimed the People's Republic of China and claimed to have succeeded the ROC as China and that the Nationalist government in Taiwan was an illegitimate representative of China."""" > """"the Communists proclaimed the People's Republic of China and claimed to have succeeded the ROC over all of China and that the ROC government in Taiwan was an illegitimate government."""" The PRC not only disputed the KMT as a representative of China in intl organizations and elsewhere. It disputed the very existence of the ROC and its very legitimacy. The former is misleading and wrong.
Removed """"While the tense standoff of the Cold War era has largely subsided"""". Text formerly here about battles is gone. this clause is no longer necessary
Removed """"on both sides of the Taiwan Strait"""". Redundant. It is contentious everywhere (in the realm of international relations etc). and this is too obvious since these are the two sides in contention.
Removed """"and one of the original five Security Council members"""". removed in the interests of brevity. keep this in the foreign relations section. a mention of the UN membership is enough.
""""Most major countries now recognize the PRC as having succeeded the ROC as the representative of China"""" > """"Most countries switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC in the 1970s"""" The former is wrong. These countries have established formal relations of the PRC, but merely """"acknowledged"""" the PRC's claims over Taiwan. They have not """"recognized"""" Taiwan as a province of the PRC and conduct de facto relations, treating Taiwan as if it were seperate.
""""recognized by 25 countries"""" > """"recognized by 25 states"""" """"states"""" is more accurate.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My concern about your username (Heavybuddha)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!   Talk   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The real problem is the set up for GOT wiki characters.  Almost unprecedented, TV viewers don't want to be subject to the 'spoilers' from the books.  If there's a possibility they will, they won't click on the wiki link.   So just a plain Jon Snow description doesn't say if it's from the book or TV or both.    Really, you should have two separate descriptions (""""Jon SnowTV series"""" and """"Jon Snowcharacter in a Song of Ice and Fire series""""), such as exist in long running TV or movies series sometimes when they are not exactly the same as the book series.

 The debate appears to be skewed. 

It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages """"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate"""" and """"Self-organization"""" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.

Bad Agendas written in to this article
Hello folks, I'm not a wiki-writer.  I just use it from time to time.  But I am familiar with problems when some pages have points of view and agendas written in to them, and the American Civil War articles are rife with these problems.  You'd think the war was still on.  This article on the 43rd Battalion is generally very good, but someone has done their best to wreck the ship, nevertheless.  A paragraph in this article goes off-track and attempts to paint a picture that these soldiers were """"guerillas"""".  Anyone familiar with the writings of the war knows this word was used extensively and daily in newspapers, official US Army reports and accounts to refer to not just uniformed soldiers of the CS Army, but to any and all people of the South.  To discuss the use of this term in this article is a coy trick to insert an agenda, intended to disparage, vice simply communicate good Wiki information about this topic.  """"Guerilla"""" was so commonly used as a term in this war, that it cannot be said, at all, that this term applied to, or was used more commonly for any one unit or group in the war, than any other.  If editors continue to keep this slant and bias in the article, and contiue deleting other fair contributions which are neutral, then my comment here serves as a marker to future editors of the proof of the problem in this page, and the particular set of self-chosen watch-guards who intend to keep it here, while pretending they are not the root cause of the problem.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Oddly, the Sante Kimes page is the one that I saw had lots of incorrect information listed on it. I agree that my first edits weren't the correct way to improve the quality of the page, but I have since tried to follow the correct procedure and post here and add tags for larger amounts of questionable information.

Yes, you have provided sources, but (perhaps in your haste) you have misquoted them. I would simply go ahead and fix these, but I don't what to appear that I am trying to disrupt the page or alter the quality of the content.

If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system.

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

 Problem with the Fundamentals Discussion - This Was Already Erased Please Investigate

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President o",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's just opposite! RU shauvenism is established and encouraged by the state policy of RF, both domestic and foreign (namely of Putin).

a7e5bff6b9708494,"Now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the Red Army's crimes!  The Red Army's crimes remain crimes - there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone.  What Wehrmacht or SS soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes-away rapes committed against women aged 8 (and lower) to 80+. Unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do. On top of that, this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations.  It's rather perverse, misogynistic, and revisionist.  A more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight-forward account of the wide-spread rapes/violence by the Red Army, including accounts from various Nazi|women/victims.  After that, background/context should be given to help understand why this happened, but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes.  In addition, a section on Soviet/Russian ways of interpreting/handling on the violence/rapes would be informative as well.  In its current form, this article does Wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements Wikipedia's reputation as an unreliable source of information.  It is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the Wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information.  

Re:  profoundly a-historical suggestion.

Contextualizing the supposed crimes, as claimed by Udibi, is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the Nazis for murdering 20,000,000 people.  I find his reference to SS Paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing, a-historical, ill-informed, and suspicious, as SS Paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military.  While Nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape, they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims.  Related, the Nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population, who in turn offered no resistance to the Nazi regime; he who keeps silent consents; these women were therefore active supporters of the Holocaust.  It would not have been difficult for them to fight against the Nazis in some way, and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20,000,000 people to be murdered.  I really see no problem of revisionism here.  I recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert Holocaust deniers.

I think we also need to consider whether this is not just a case of hundreds of thousands of German women getting lucky with their liberators (a view shared by many Germans, described in The Fall of Berlin 1945) and then telling local Nazi leaders or Werewolf members that they were raped, in a regime where they could not openly have any sort of relationship with Russians.

So much so that these you have to become a mindless vanda-fight admin-gnome on Wikipedia cause that's the only productive thing you can do.

I hope you don't take this the wrong way. I'm just trying to help somebody with far less mental facility than I.

Not being used to Wiki process I didn't see the warning until after it was made although I'm not sure what that difference would have made long term. The notion of fascism in respect of the operation of wiki is not meant as an insult but describes a particular way of operating a nation, organisation etc. Having spent many years dealing with institutional abuse of authority etc. the """"harassment"""" of my contribution was corporate, but for those very reasons it will not be a productive line of enquiry. I suppose I could also turn to a zealous enforcement of the rules and seek wiki awards. 
Anyway in respect of my request we're now leaving wiki territory in terms of copyright and going where statutory law applies. Can you point me in the direction of an administrator or agent of wiki that can deal with this issue knowledgeabley? I haven't assigned copyright to wiki and wiki policy can't supersede law. I suppose I could formally assign copyright of all those images to a third party which would immediately create a wiki violation.
I'd also be interested in views about the difference between self-interest in requiring attribution and that notion in respect of links. It's a mark (and again this is a valid view) of paternalistic and authoritarian operations no matter how benign to operate arbitrarily without explanation. I'm asking this because there is a prima facia contradiction in application of the stated rules, although I'm not expecting this to receive an effective explanation this time any more than last.

After several hours work on the Dylan track at Regent Sound, pianist Phil Coulter went home and Scott called a break.  'The number wasn't going down', Scott remembers. 'Van wasn't sure. Then the guys said he didn't fancy it and thought it was cheap because I'd tried to go after the 'Here Comes The Night' tempo.' Scott reconsidered and after picking up a blues riff, a new arrangement emerged, apparently with added piano work from Peter Bardens.

I rewrote somewhat to avoid a combining of the traditions of different parts of Polynesia. I also tried to change the emphasis in the opening line to Pulotu as 'Polynesian mythology' which gives the mistaken impression that the concept is found all over Polynesia. It is important to maintain the separation of the individual traditions - otherwise we are at risk of rewriting the traditions. The association made with the Māori concepts of Hawaiki and Te Reinga I thought was taking it a little too far - Hawaiki is not always/often conceived of that way by my people. I also took out a reference to 'Purotu' since there was no evidence offered that the word occuring in that form means underworld. I also took out the reference to Pulotu having changed in Tahitian to purotu meaning a girl of marrying age. The word occurs in many Eastern Polynesian languages with the meaning beautiful:

If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning.
The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days.  Place names were informal, and often duplicated.  There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as """"Ballast Point"""" then.  This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.  The revised wording gives me the impression that there was only one place of that name in the 1800s, and it changed.

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Antilles 212,226
 Aruba 103,000
 Suriname 438,144
the population of these three regions doesnt reach one million, and Dutch is definetly not a national language in these places. Plus, the Netherlands and Belgium have a lot of immigrants. So I belive more in the 20 million figure, rather than the 23 million one.- 5 July 2005 11:27 (UTC)
There are for example probably about 12 million native speakers in the Netherlands, once you sutract immigrants, Frisian, Limburgish, and other Germanic language speakers. Suriname definitely isn't natively Dutch speaking; some of the languages there are closer to English (if you can even recognize gbe for 'leave' as derived from English!). So 20 million may be a rather generous number.  2005 July 5 17:50 (UTC)

Yeah, i was reading around it and it's pretty bad as is.. as i see it, the Physical Chemistry article should be a similar kind of article as the Thermodynamics article is; an overview of the key principles included in the actual thing itself as well as the foundation of it. I've not got too many books on physical chemistry  on the article itself, i've only got about 4 of those mentioned.

The majority of the books i have featuring physical chemistry tell me also that chemical physics seem to be some forms of misprints, or so  there was a story on how someone published the name incorrectly due to the fact they thought it was mostly based in chemistry, so therefore it was chemistry with physics in it; chemical physics. Not too sure about it though.. chemical physics could be a pseudonym for thermodynamics of activation or something similar; who knows? The books, i guess! -)",0,0,0,0,0,0

2 –POW losses of 1.6 million are included with civilian dead.
3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses.
4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .
7-The Germans had 1 million Soviet deserters in their Army. 215,000 were killed in action. The need to be included with German losses
8- In addition to the war losses of 26.6 million the Russians and the PC crowd in the west  tend  to ignore the1.7 million Soviet citizens that died due to communist terror ( I realize is not NPV but it is a fact that can’t be ignored)

Would it be possible to slow the VFDTOAFD bot down?  It's not overwhelming the bandwidth or resources of Wikipedia, but it is overwhelming the ability of human eyes to monitor the pagemove log (more than 5000 edits today alone).  Once any currently-being-voted-on VfD's are converted to AfD (I think that happened already quite some time ago), the old archived ones can be converted at much more leisurely pace, no?  Perhaps a few hundred a day?  Hardly anyone ever really looks at old archived VfD's, so there's no screaming urgency.  My worry is specifically that vandals may sneak in some pagemove vandalism in there that no one will catch, in the midst of thousands and thousands of other pagemoves, or a vanity userspace page will get moved to article space and no one will catch it (last time I checked, such a pagemove didn't show up in the Newpages log).

 I've seen this with other breeds abroad, unless some people pick them up and promote them, the kennel clubs just don't know they exist. Likewise, with academic studies. I have no idea what family/pack groups they create, or who or what they pack with. I've read a bit about feral dogs in general, and the material is against the idea of their packs. More often just pairs or small groups. This is why I asked. I don't know what IPD do naturally. Joing wolf packs does not sound right. Wolves are known to kill and eat domestic dogs. They are just too different now. But I know it's not enough to guess on the Wikipedia.

We recently wrote an article for a liquid Instant Hand Sanitizer called Germ Out. We very carefully followed the same format and information (including a picture of the product) as the Purell article. Since we followed the same format and information, we do not understand why the Germ Out article was deleted by one of your editors. Will someone please explain why the following Germ Out article was deleted and the Purell article has not been deleted?

== Germ Out ==

Germ Out is a liquid instant hand sanitizer that contains two germ killers, 70 wt% isopropyl alcohol and 0.02 wt% benzalkonium chloride and a moisturizer, glycerin. Germ Out kills 99.99% of germs on the hands in 30 seconds. All alcohol gels, including Purell and Germ X etc., contain one germ killer, 62 v% ethyl alcohol. Two germ killers are significantly more effective than one germ killer and 70 wt% alcohol kills germs better than 62 v% alcohol. Since Germ Out is a liquid and not a gel, it spreads easier and more completely and it does not leave any """"sticky"""" residue after it dries. Germ Out can be sprayed on the hands as a fine mist or added drop by drop from a flip top applicator. After wetting the hands thoroughly with Germ Out, they are rubbed together until the alcohol evaporates in approximately 30 seconds. Unlike the alcohol gels which kill germs for only 30 seconds, Germ Out continues killing germs for approximately 4 hours due to the second germ killer benzalkonium chloride which remains on the hands after the alcohol is gone.

Germ Out is a product of J & A Companies,L.L.C. and was first manufactured 1998 and first sold on the internet the same year.

Germ Out has been used by the US Navy, Airforce, and the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It has been used by Medical Personnel, Law Enforcement Officers, Schools, Day Care Centers, and the General Public.

Germ Out is flammable and should not be used around fire, spark, or flame. Children under 6 years old should not use Germ Out without adult supervision. Inactive ingredients in Germ Out include glycerin and water.

Re: Alcohol laws of New Jersey. If you have a problem with centuries being spelled out (nineteenth and twentieth instead of 19th and 20th) you probably shouldn't have pointed to a policy (WP:CENTURY) that allows either form (in this case spelling it out) only requiring that usage be consistent. Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already """"internally consistent"""" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing. If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page.  This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless.

Hi Tavix. How are you doing? I think I need to ask you for your help, if you don't mind helping a newbie, since i can see that you've had experience in editing articles, and seem to be an authority on article qualification. Again, I'm new to wikipedia, and I have one purpose here, to have a page for the hockey league I belong to. I have read countless help articles, linking to other help articles, linking to more help articles.  I've read 'notibility', 'articles for deletion', 'deletion policy guidlines', in my efforts to save my page from the few people who seem to want the page gone forever. These people have not giving any advice, just citing everything that's wrong with the page, and nothing that is right.  Can I change your mind on windsor floor hockey league, and, your proposing on deleting it?  I would do whatever possible to comply with the rules of wikipedia and have read quite alot in the guidelines about why the page SHOULD be included. (so many, i donno where to begin -social & recreational clubs have a place on wiki -  -Included in the article is a physical address of where the games take place, some article i read said that stands for something- there's alot of reasons why it SHOULD exist on wikipedia and about two or three small debatable issues about lack of notibility). I included all the league's website and pages, and it's not like anyone is debating the truthfulness of the article, but they do insist on citing the page for 1. notability, 2. More independant sources.   Where i have done the best i possibly can, I included all the links EVER available,   And having said that, ask any of the 80+ families that are effected by this league, in a town, during a time, where 10% of it's population has been laid off indefinitely.   This league is notable to me, and to others, isn't that enough for you?

Can you answer me this: how is this league not notable to the people and families who CARE about it, notibility is in the eye of the beholder.

Hi Wikipedians. If anyone is interested I have been updating my own biography, which had fallen a little out of date. For example a new edition of one of the published works mentioned was published on 9 June 2013. It is not a commercial publication, therfore I posit I am not adding information about the revised edition for personal commercial gain. The book is a community environmental resource. I hope my material on myself is transparent, balanced, and written according to Wikipedia guidelines despite my obvious conflict of interest. The Wikimedia community here in Brisbane, Queensland, is not very active at the moment (I am a member of Wikimedia Australia) and all the editors I know I haven't been in contact for some time and I suspect they haven't the time to look at the page and update it. On balance, I believe it is better to update the page myself to reflect true facts than leave it out of date. I would welcome any copmments, suggestions or feedback on this matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Maps and Cathedrals. 

Please stop adding maps to those already lengthy cathedral boxes.  They are superfluous.  Every cathedral is in a city. Every city has a map.  Putting maps for the cathedrals themselves is overkill. 

It's like this:  if a significant person is mentioned within the context of an article, then we link that person's biography.  We don't give the dates of the person's life, unless they are absolutely relevant to the text of the article e.g. """"the architect John Bloggs died in 1455, leaving the spire incomplete.""""  If john Bloggs has his own article then we don't write """"John Bloggs (1402-1455) built the spire"""".   

Similarly, if a person wants to know where Chichester Cathedral is, within Sussex,  they will look at Chichester. 

The problem is that maps and lists in the right hand box take up space that is much better utilised by pictures.  Cathedrals are visually among the most important works of art that have been created.  Great long lists of cleargy and specifications don't need to be in the right hand box, any more than the map does.  The lists can go anywhere else in the article.  But the right hand side, particularly within the first paragraphs of the main body of text, is the prime space for illustrating the building, its history, its style and so on.  Cathedral websites,  (well-done cathedral websites) never give lengthy lists of people on the home page.  They give a link to where you can find that stuff if you want it.  They also give a link to """"how to find us"""".  They don't attempt to put a map on the home page. 

Jamming a map in, to take up space where there could be a plan of the building or a photo of the interior, is not useful.

Many thanks for checking and investigating. It is a shame there's nothing more recent. From p23 of Curatolo(2003), """"Diagnosic Criteria"""", I get:
The rate of occurrence of tuberous sclerosis at birth is unknown...(paragraph continues with stats trying to come up with a figure)... This indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as 1:6000 (Webb et al. 1993, Cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis, Arch Dis Child 68:367–70)

Earlier, when talking about Hunt and Lindenbaum's 1984 study, he says """"The scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be."""" I don't have that paper so don't have more details.

An editorial by Fryer (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1991, 84:699) says """"... suggesting a birth incidence of 1:10000"""". I don't have the Osborne paper you mention. I've seen 1:5800 mentioned but don't know its source at present.

My sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. I'm happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.

The list of prevalence figures throughout the years comes from Curatolo (2003), Table 2.6, page 22. This in turn is based on an earlier table by Shepherd in his short chapter """"The Epidemiology of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex"""" in the book Gomez 1999.

75d5c1abc5b7fb25,"To ERS and others. I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias's policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft's website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka's own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that's okay with everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,0

2f46bbaa7eb4266a,"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk )",0,0,0,0,0,0

 This is the last time I am going to tell you: Stop vandalising and stop disturbing me 

Family names are a valid article. Each family name in every language can be an article. Instead of your Serbophobic (and therefore racist, since you are apparently Korean, at least that is what you claim) vandalism edits, go and do something useful like making wiki articles for Korean family names. Most certainly do not ever again take the liberty to tell me what to do, because you have neither right nor authority to do that and your snotty and inappropriate comments are unwelcome.

Eventually, as I have already replied at the ludicrous discussion you started  where, BTW, no one took your side  I will create longer pages for each individual family name when I have time. They will be full articles in their own right. For now, leave the Serbian family names alone and do not input vandalism redirects to specific people. People are people and they have their own article and names are names and they have their own articles AS NAMES, not as incidental necessity for redirection. 

Further your comparison with the family name """"Hitler"""" is absolutely abhorrent, as all people who had that family name have changed it after WW II, so that family name does indeed relate to only a signe person. And even so, it would still be possible to write an article about the family name as such, but it's not my interest, so I won't do it. However, writing such an article would be legitimate and such an article could exist as a wikipedia article.

On the links that you have been posting on my page (and which I am going to delete, because they are unnecessary on may talk page) it says VERY CLEARLY: """"MAY"""" and NOT """"MUST"""". Are you really incapable of comprehending the difference between the two? If you are, stop editing Wikipedia altogether because all your edits are likely to be violation of rules.

And, I repeat: do not come to scribble nonsense on my wall again. I have nothing to tell you that I haven't told you three times already and I do not want your inconsequential silly musings on my wall. Go away!!

As reliable sources clearly acknowledges, reliability isn't binary: """"The reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made…"""" The question is whether they're reliable for what they set out to prove. Flannelette Murmurings would be useless as a source if it was for the idea that Potts is a more important violin player than Warren Ellis or Nigel Kennedy, say, but is a perfectly decent source for the proof of a simple, incontrovertible fact, namely that Potts plays in a band called Cuba is Japan. The idea the author made up the band, and therefore the interview, is exceedingly unlikely. ¶ The other source should obviously have been removed regardless of it's reliability, since it seemed to be primarily about a charity cooking event and didn't match the point it was supposed to illustrate.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

The Canadian Heraldic Authority article is a good example of where Crown Copyright images can be used (although since it's the text description of a coat of arms that's definitive, not the visual representation, anyone could draw up a depiction of one of those coats of arms and release it under GFDL).

723420ecad19ad5a,First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit.

Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren't banned from getting doctorates? That's rather silly indeed.
Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn't that you're trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too); rather, it's that you're trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think that the Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of """"science"""".
Also, that's an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. And how many people on that list are actually biologists?
Also, a """"criticisms"""" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it's finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered. It's not a scientific topic, however, but a social and historical one, so it will have little mention in the top-level article, Evolution. -

WP:Policy

Fairness of tone
If we're going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone. Many articles end up as partisan commentary even while presenting both points of view. Even when a topic is presented in terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still radiate an implied stance through either selection of which facts to present, or more subtly their organization — for instance, refuting opposing views as one goes along makes them look a lot worse than collecting them in an opinions-of-opponents section.

We should, instead, write articles with the tone that all positions presented are at least plausible, bearing in mind the important qualification about extreme minority views. Let's present all significant, competing views sympathetically. We can write with the attitude that such-and-such is a good idea, except that, in the view of some detractors, the supporters of said view overlooked such-and-such a detail.

Now let me mention one thing to you;

If a name Khan was mentioned twice and you were having """"""""preservations"""" against them.

You would have discussed it before, otherwsie you would have deleted Khan a single time.
But you didn't done this, instead you deleted, edited and vandalised whole of the article, as usuall. This was against WP's policy.

At last, let me share one thing. Obscure people should never be allowed having a space in """"Noteable Marwats"""". If they are allowed then they must have true face. I recently read Khan Habibullah Khan, at 3 national dailys. Were they also advertising or are you against him only pulling tribal enimity?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Although the Christian/Jewish contradiction may be attributed to the relationship between the two religions, the fact that the entire thing is made clear by the fact that the meanings of love """"come out better in Latin"""" raises a few red flags for me.

I have argued, but to no avail, that when a free image turns up (there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now), that event renders my present copyright statement invalid, at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image.

Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule. This can clearly be seen when you read and understand the Roman Britain-Anglo-Saxon battles in Germanic Wars.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hypocrites

 you're a liberal hypocrite plain and simple just like your other liberal moderator and admin friends on here: you apply your rules in bias and unevenly when it comes to whatever and """"whoever"""" appears to be fundamentalist to you. You're a liar just like your father Satan, and nothing can change that but God. If you laugh, that only makes your hypocrisy worse. I can easily sight you mods and admins repeatedly harassing me and breaking the three revert rule by gang warring, which you conveniently sanction for liberals like yourself, yet you don't seem to notice that as """"sock puppetry"""", why is that? Because you are a blind hypocrite who is too busy flattering yourself and those who pander like you. You've been thoroughly warned of your hypocrisy, and no you have little excuse before God to continue being a hypocritical liar.

Any reading public can see that my previous answer was already an answer to everything Redwolf has just written. It is corrupt to accuse anyone of """"abusing Wikipedia"""", whether they have or not, at the same time as blocking their ability to present the dispute to the wider """"community""""(joke) on all the pages that in name exist for doing that. To have dispute-sharing sections that exist in name but blocks imposable by 1 person that prevent you using them, is an abuse of public trust and a deliberate arrangement for corruption.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

I'm not sure I get your point.  Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.  Indeed, many trolling groups and individuals try to obscure or hide the fact that they're trolls, which often makes their activities more successful. Therefore, phrase is clearly relevant and not POV.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

db09449d3ca2efd2,"student uprising 1973 

I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages.  I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s.

The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here.

I am still haunted by what I saw, and that was 32 years ago. I chose your user name from the discussion page because of the passion you wrote with in the wording of several of the sections (although they were changed from your original wording).  From this I came to think that you must believe somewhat strongly in presenting the material accurately and as completely as possible.

a3ad7f2a01b9d1cf,"The old taxobox template? 
Hi!

I know you are busy with the cactus, but I hope you can help me out. On the Norwegian Wikipedia, we have since the beginning used a taxobox without ranks. This has been due to early influence from a single editor, which has since gone unchallenged until a year ago or so. Now, we finally have the consensus to change over to a ranked system, the only problem is that there seem to be no-one capable (or willing) of doing the coding of something as complex as a taxo-box. The bio-editors over at Norwegian WP are just just a handful of people, all of which seem to be as techically inclined as yours truly.

So, I had the bright idea to import and translate the old (non-auto) taxobox from English. I don't know anything about coding, but since the ranks are in latin, I suppose it should be possible to understand what bits need translation. The only problem is, I don't know how to find the code. Do you have access to it? If so, would it be possible for you to post the code on this test page?",0,0,0,0,0,0

User:Mr. Stradivarius has consistently removed heavily sourced paragraphs and kept replacing them, until just recently, with unsourced hagiography. The following are the sourced (which he maliciously calls unsourced) paragraphs that were removed: 
TAB
According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book By Way of Deception, the Mossad """"was deeply involved with several other warring Lebanese families, paying for information, passing it between groups, even paying the gangs and some Palestinians in the refugee camps for intelligence and services. Besides Gemayel, both the Jumblatt and Berri families were on the Mossad payroll. Source: Ostrovsky, Victor (1990). By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer, p. 316
TAB
Berri is involved in corruption allegations regarding a 1996 coastal motorway in southern Lebanon. The contract for the motorway was won by a firm run by Berri's wife, Randa Assi, and was said to be overpriced by over three hundred million US dollars. Sources: Johnson, Michael (2001). All Honorable Men: The Social Origins Of War In Lebanon , p.236; Schwerna, Tobias (2010). Lebanon: A Model of Consociational Conflict , p.128. 

In 2004, Berri was mentioned in several of the diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. One cable said that Amal is """"near universally derided as corrupt to the core"""", and that Berri was described by a relative of Musa al-Sadr as having provided social services in the south only through """"wheeling, dealing, and stealing"""". Also according to the cables, Berri receives USD 400,000 a month from Iran, using a fourth of the sum to shore up his support and pocketing the rest. Sources: Gloria Center, Wikileaks cables. 

According to one source, Berri was considered by Rafik Hariri to be """"irredeemably corrupt and unreliable"""", as well as an opportunist, and is thought to maintain his support base through access to state funds. Source:  Blanford, Nicholas (2006). Killing Mr. Lebanon: The Assasination of Rafik Hariri and Its Impact on the Middle East , p. 118

According to leaked diplomatic cables, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Berri, publicly an ally of Hezbollah, described Israel's attacks on Hezbollah to US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as being """"like honey"""", and hoped that Israel would complete its mission against Hezbollah quickly. He suggested that the IDF """"markedly improve its targeting intelligence to make air strikes more effective. Either that, or they would have to wipe Hizballah out of the south with a ground offensive."""" He also suggested that """"if Israel succeeds in weakening Hizballah militarily, then he will be more willing to weaken them politically"""". Sources: Wikileaks cables, NOW Media, Aspen Institute, Middle East Online. 

Berri's sister-in-law and close business associate Samira Assi, is said to have made a fortune by getting a contract from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to print one million copies of Gaddafi's """"Green Book"""". Assi's deals are seen as highly controversial, since the founder of the Amal Movement, Musa al-Sadr, is known to have been disappeared on the orders of Gaddafi himself. Sources: Middle East Intelligence Bulletin report, written by the current news director of Congress-funded Al Hurra.

So basically, your plan is to find any single record which disagrees with all other records and that is the one you are going with.  In the case of Mike Sharperson, Social Security records suffice so you change his birth year to 1960 - even though all other sources say 1961.  But, in the case of Larry MacPhail, Social Security records agree with all other sources that his birth year was 1890 so instead you use his draft records - apparently the only source that shows 1888 - and change all references to his birth year to 1888.  Except in the case of MacPhail - as well as Casey Stengel and Chief Bender - his own gravestone disagrees with you (yes, there is a picture here)!  Doesn't that mean that MacPhail faked his date of birth for the draft and not the other way around?!  And Stengel's fake birth certificate was the one that said 1889?  You say Chief Bender's sister found his birth certificate in 1942 and it said he was born in 1883.  Then why did he have 1884 put on his gravestone when he died - 12 years later?!

This tactic of yours gives the appearance that records are only good enough for you when they make you look like the hero investigator - the one who cut through all popular misconceptions and """"found the truth once and for all"""".  Social Security records are gospel in one case (Sharperson) but are bunk in others (MacPhail and others).  If you're really writing a book using this tactic - and without pointing out that those dates are the lone exceptions - then you should really be ashamed.  And if your editors and publishing company don't point out the error of your ways, they should likewise be ashamed.  And if you think that research like that is going to be permitted on Wikipedia, then you are mistaken.  Please do read WP:ATT and its related pages and understand that your lone exception style of research is the exact opposite of how we do things here.  —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

While I would personally prefer that we said something like “Ham’s claims have been disproven by modern science” (because I think it sounds more authoritative), if it’s between “incorrect” or nothing then “incorrect” is clearly the superior choice because it is factually true.

Paul Tibbit is a fucking-ass little piece of smelly donkey shit that raped SpongeBob rock-hard!!! 
I hope Paul Tibbit gets fucking cancer and burns in hell!
PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!
SpongeBob is a pile of crap now. I don't think I've ever hated a person more than I hate Paul Tibbit. Him and his piss-poor animation skills.
Yeh Tibbit is SUCH A HOMO!!!!
I hope he fucking dies!

I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!!  SCREW YOU PAUL!!!!
Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. 

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty. Sure there may be some people out there who like the new SpongeBob, but anyone that does may never understand the meaning of good quality. In conclusion, FUCK YOU PAUL TIBBIT!!! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!!

Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds
By Dr. Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds * 

""""When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?"""" 

Principle I – Empiric – Entity and World Scale relationship: 
In the Universe each Entity (constellation, star, planet, animal, vegetable, micro organism, molecule, …) belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE (Average Life Time Scale) and the SPACE SCALE (Average Size Scale) of the Entity. 

Principle II – Empiric – The fulfillment principle: 
Each particular Entity, in its Space Scale, has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to, also, complete its life cycle with success. 

Principle III – Empiric – World Scales existence: 
According to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us – microorganisms, molecules, atoms, … – and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us – planets, stars, constellations, .... 

Principle IV – Empiric – Time and Space Relationship: 
The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. 
Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales – the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly – so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. 
Example of an empiric formula that can be applied: 

Life_Scale = K x Space_Scale 
( K ~ 30 years/meters for mammals ) 

Principle V – Empiric – Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence: 
In Euclid’s geometry, if we consider ourselves a point in a plan, we only can observe just a line: this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world, we only can percept one dimension. 
The same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) there is, at least, another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in. Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. 
This takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with, at least, an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand, because they are imaginary to us: i=(-1) ½. 

Principle VI – Empiric – Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective: 
Can we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue? If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension, because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale, it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon. The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) ½. 
So, we have to introduce two new concepts: the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence. 
RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale. 
RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand, to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scale’s Relative Perspective. By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials. 
So, the Human Kind or any other Entity, only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real (and not Imaginary) in the World Scale of that Entity. Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions, i=(-1) ½, in their mathematical models. 

Principle VII – Empiric – The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle: 
Why our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines? Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but, instead, the cosmos is splitting itself? How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand? Obviously there is, at least, an extra imaginary dimension that we cannot percept or understand from our World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) that relates the different MULTI-DIMENSIONAL WORLD SCALES above and",0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe Tim could be the judge on what is the most suitable. Just to clarify the error in VH&W;, the omission of DQ2.2 (DQA1*02, DQB1*02) was a small error, the statement that (DQA1*05 without DQB1*02) was a """"partial DQ2"""" is an error. To understand why this is an error one has to read  which basically found that all DQA1*0501 previously type in Europe split 2 ways, DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0505:DQB1*0301 (I was scolded by a referee for not knowing this and not knowing DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501
were process to DQA1*05) DQA1*0505 is part of the DR5-DQ7 haplotype, therefore in assigning DQA1*05 without DQ2, it is a DQ7.

The """"neat, plausible and wrong"""" solution will only work up until DQ2.2 hits the reviewed literature, then it needs to be dealt with. At 4% of all coeliacs it may never reach that level of appreciation. yap 20:13""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

So in this example, Team C would win the tie breaker with +31, Team A will be second
with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.
So, if this right , the standing in Euroleague 2009–10 is also correct.connect """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not the """"paid editor"""" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as """"deception"""" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of """"benefit"""" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any """"money, goods or services""""). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing """"scandal"""" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 If He Was Terrorist 

Czech President Miloš Zeman has criticized Ukrainian leaders Stepan Bandera (1909-59) and Roman Shukhevych (1907-50), saying he cannot congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes in his response to an open letter by four Ukrainian studies scholars and historians.

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Bandera’s statement “Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years” and whether they agree with it.
If you have not heard these words by Bandera, you are not ukrainists. And if you know about that statement, then do you agree with him or not? If you agree, then our debate is over"""" - wrote Zeman. He continues saying Bandera wanted to establish a vassal German state in the Ukraine.   http://www.praguepost.com/world-news/43706-zeman-criticizes-historical-ukrainian-leaders 

That cannibalistic statement alone brings Badera into the 1st rank terrorists with plans of henocide (a crime agains humanity), let alone many terrorist actions under his command, for example in Poland. As nobody denies these facts, the Article must be on his terrorism only with all other passages having been deleted as unimportant. Въ 95.220.87.246  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm arguing for the page to state that Artpop received general positive reviews with a disclaimer afterwards that states that the reception has been more ambivalent than her past works. STATic has been engaged in this debate for months and has admitted twice that he dislikes Lady Gaga and even made fun of her and her fans, which obviously constitutes WP:Bias. Homeostasis has previously been blocked from editing due to his unprofessional behavior on Gaga pages and has recently admitted that he's been accused numerous times of bias against the artist in question.

I am slowly working on many of the mountains of Washington.  I do one or two a day.
I have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created.  One is a list of highest points in each of Washington's 39 counties.  I research if they need disambiguation.  So for Big Horn mountain I had to research whether there were other things called Big Horn - there are tons of them.  As you can see there are hundreds of uses of Big Horn.  If I can, I find newspaper articles relating to the place.   But due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep, businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship... I have not been able to isolate one article about Big Horn.  Big Horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in Lewis County, Washington.  But I did find a couple of trip reports.

Ok, so I see he has made many lies. 
1. The Encyclopaedia of Ukraine is the best source for Ukraine on the English language.
2. It is written by Ukrainians. 
3. The figure I provided IS the most """"mainstream view"""" of Ukrainians, since it stands in the Ukrainian encyclopaedia.. Also, the Ukrainian article of the battle of Poltava supports my view, both in Swedish Casualties AND Swedish strength. 
4. The Swedish Historian's figures are the mainstream among Swedish historians. 
5. Russian imperial figures ARE NOT Soviet figures. The Figueres in the Soviet encyclopaedia are historic estimates as well. Also, the Soviet encyclopaedia is underestimated. Many Swedes think it is just a book of lies, but it is actually a valuable source, and is frequently used to determine casualties in wiki articles, particularly Russian (like in the siege of Sevastopol).   
6. The cute thing now is, that Narking tries to turn ME as the bad guy. All I did was write the Ukrainian POW, and he removed it, arrogantly stating: """"Stop confusing the reader!"""". This is how the entire arguments started.
7. The battle of Grengam article is only a mess in his head. Look at it admin, please. I also see that it has been changed into an even better one, after the editing of another user. 
8. I request that the user Narking is banned from editing Battle of Poltava and Battle of Grengam if he continues with his annoying, and vandalizing edits.

Never going to happen, so you might as well give up on that tidbit, and again, I stand by what I say.  At the time you left the comment, he had gone to bed.  That doesn't give you the right to be an absolute jerk to him and insult him just because he didn't respond instantly.  As to why he hasn't responded further, that is quite obvious: he already explained to you his reasoning.  He does not have to defend himself to you, and you are the only person who thinks he is abusive.  I don't expect you to apologize, but know this, if you continue on the path you are on now, you will get blocked.— dαlus Contribs 
You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

If you notice, there was already a video clip of Dr. Holtzapple giving a presentation (reference #2 in present version), but in that clip he presents about a lot of things, whereas in the ones I added, he concentrates only on Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohols fuels.  What exactly made you think that this was a """"shameless pushing for publicity"""" as you put it? The name of the company that is commercializing this technology (i.e., Terrabon, L.L.C.) does not appear ANYWHERE in those video clips, only the University LOGO of the College of Agriculture who were the ones who made the video clips.

As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society?

That leaves only the book; quite frankly, one reference in passing by a book does not outweigh both what Tiger has said himself on television, and what is being contended in this OTRS ticket (#2009061110035594) by someone who is authorised to represent him.

I propose that both the """"Tont"""" from the lead, and the short sentence relating to how he got it, both of which are sourced to the in-passing remark in that book, be removed. I ask for your comments in forming a consensus before doing so, however.\

But in this article Anime is not clearly defined as Japanese Animation, it just says it usually refers to a style of animation originating in Japan and than says the term may also be used for other animation originating in Japan or to anime proper, irrespective of style.

That is so erroneous.  The subject of the article did the act in a public place, so he should expect to have it publicly documented. He's a public figure in that respect, just as well.  If Manson did the criminal acts, it will be documented irrespective of how bad it impugns him, and so it follows if the subject of the article extended his middle finger, as photographed by an AP photographer, it will be documented as part of that scandalous conduct irrespective of whether the action of the subject causes a self-inflicted impugning of his character in the process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
